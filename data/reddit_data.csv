481.0,Post,17c1fu7,summary of the whole ntusu/üççeating ong saga,Ok_Trifle1130,2023-10-20 03:14:07+00:00,"I don‚Äôt side with anyone in this whole saga, however, I have been a casual observer enjoying all the popcorn and drama. Also waiting for the slow campus red.

Since there‚Äôs a lot of confusion with each new saga episode, I thought I‚Äôll list all the facts we‚Äôve gotten if anyone wants to catch up:

EPISODE 1: the original incident 
1. (As reported in every news media outlet out there, and acknowledged by the man himself) an SU small committee decided to have a bonding event where freshman junior got drunk. She and Raj requested for üçç to give water, but üçç secretly snuck a few glasses of alcohol pretending it was water. The other members saw and then proceeded to stop him when girl passed out in his room. A few of them stayed behind to ensure nothing more happens. 

So just to be clear, what was done crosses some grey boundaries, but there wasn‚Äôt SA or rape (the eyewitnesses have went to the media too). Even though there were allegations because SU was so hush hush about it. 

2. Apparently Raj told eyewitnesses to not tell the girl what happened and instructed the whole SU not to say also. I‚Äôve also heard sources from SU themselves that üçç went to show everyone photos of the girl being drunk/dizzy/toh-ed from drinking and was laughing about it the next day. Seems like he thought it was just a prank? Albeit not a well-executed one. 

3. üççkena 5 week suspension in SU, but heard from the AGM that this was meted out by Raj and üçç‚Äôs friend (not sure which one) so SU promises not to be so ‚Äúownself check ownself‚Äù in the future. Anyways you can argue that Eaten has already been punished but according to the news articles, the suspension wasn‚Äôt even adhered to properly because SU gave him more leadership opportunities during this time wow! This was why a lot of people were mad at SU btw. 

4. This incident was only reported at this time not because Ethan did anything explicitly illegal, but because SU being nepo SU, made sure he was the sole candidate running for President. 

This is valid bah. The President of NTU represents the school in front of the ministry and gives speeches on behalf of us, surely it can‚Äôt be a guy going around making girls drunk for pranks. 

EPISODE 2: Eaten‚Äôs rally

5. If you look at the SU email, the whole rally ended at 4 am because üçç‚Äôs qna was too long. Even if SU made sure he was the sole candidate, he still kena 20 against and 7 for votes, live-reported in WakeUpSingapore.

According to some rally-goers, Eaten also was called out for cancelling a committee event. Btw if you look at the Reddit post posting SU‚Äôs budget, the cancelled event (6/7k SGD) was still factored in lmao.

EPISODE 3: LAWSUIT!

6. This NUS girlie that no one knew made a LinkedIn post that speculated about his actions and alluded to his actions being SA even though it didn‚Äôt happen. 

Ethan has proceeded to sue her for 100K. He has every rights to prevent himself from being defamed, but people are angry that it‚Äôs a power-move because he didn‚Äôt give the girl a chance to delete and apologise, which even MPs do. 

Also the school gave him LOA just for this lawsuit to happen.

EPISODE 4: AGM (informal because never hit quota)


7. People are angry at three things: - SU takes union fees from everyone but the budget so sus and non-transparent
- SU ownself checks ownself
- Eaten and Raj both didn‚Äôt show up, when usually the previous batch turns up for the rally (+outgoing president speech was cancelled)

8. SPMS guy angy during QNA and stormed out because SU kept evading questions 

9. The profs were defending SU mad-hard so the girl from the alcohol incident used qna to call them out for it

EPISODE 5: other weird facts

10. In a Reddit post now removed by mods, Eaten was exposed for his history of dating a minor (15 years old). 

Since a lot of screenshots of his ex‚Äôs photos with him are circulating around, pls practise PDPA btw üò• 

He was also exposed for publishing homophobic content on his social media and for parking in handicapped parking lots in his hall. 

New updates as of this week: üçç edited his LinkedIn to remove parts that showed his involvement in SU during his suspension! Additionally, his ex archived posts with him before she was 16, but unarchived some posts after she was 16. Lawsuit preparation must be going strong! 

So yes that‚Äôs the not-so-brief summary of everything (proven) that happened. Have a good day.

I was part of the NTU Students‚Äô Union 28th Executive Committee in AY2018/19 as the Corporate Communications Executive (Relations). I am here to share my story.

OK, now that I‚Äôve got your attention, this post is not about any particular individual or even a set of people. It is about the *NTU Students‚Äô Union* as an institution and mode of government.

I will not name anyone in this post because I know my peers would rather not be entangled in this matter, not to mention that they have moved on with their lives anyway. (Crucially, I am not interested in being SLAPPed with a lawsuit.) I‚Äôm only here because I‚Äôve been in NTU for longer than most people I know - first as an undergraduate and now as a graduate student.

This post is a singular reflection of *my* experience with the Students‚Äô Union: what I thought it *was*, what it *really* was then, what it *is* now, and what it *could* be.

Therefore, a confession of sorts, though I have nothing to be ashamed of, as you will see.

## What the Students‚Äô Union was to Me, Part 1: The Introduction

I was peripherally involved with Union activities in Year 1. I was a member-minion of the Open House Committee, and my task was to secure partnerships with external organisations. The Open House work was basic, but I enjoyed seeing the event coalesce via that invisible thread of camaraderie interlacing it. Through that opportunity, I met others, some of whom would eventually become my teammates in the 28th NTUSU Executive Committee (henceforth SU/Union and Exco).

When asked to consider running as an SU Exco member in Year 2, I was starry-eyed at the prospect. And why wouldn‚Äôt I be? It promised to be an avenue for me to create change as I envisioned it. And I *had* dreams: I wanted to revitalise the floundering Union magazine, U-Insight, and transform it into an avenue where students could express themselves. I wanted to improve the communication channels between SU and the student body, mainly so that student feedback, previously scattered across sources, could be consolidated into a single place to amplify its voice.

I had dreams, and I wanted to achieve them. The position of Relations Executive offered me just that; it gave me power - the ability to influence events in the direction of my will.

And who wouldn‚Äôt want that?

So off I went to the elections, full of hope and ambition.

## What the Students‚Äô Union was to Me, Part 2: The Election

Let me explain how the Union (Executive Committee) electoral process works. Again. Because I‚Äôve done this [before](https://u-insight.com/2018/10/25/what-is-ntusu/), but let me do it again.

The SU Executive Committee is not elected by the students. The Union *Council* is elected by the *students*. The Executive Committee is elected *by the Council*.

Some context is necessary.

Anyone who glances through the [NTUSU website](https://ntusu.org/) might think the Council is the Executive Committee. It is not.

The Council is composed of:

* The Executive Committee
* The Academic Constituent Clubs (a fancy way of saying ‚Äúschool clubs‚Äù) - e.g. School of Social Sciences Club, Biological Sciences Club. All students are part of the club whose name matches their school.
* The Non-Academic Constituent Clubs (i.e. the Big Three Clubs that seem to pervade every aspect of CCA life) - WSC, Sports Club, CAC. All students are members of ALL NACCs (bet you didn‚Äôt know that! And that‚Äôs why you can vote in their elections, even if you don‚Äôt participate in their activities or volunteer).

The power distribution within the NTUSU Council has baffled me, though certainly, I had no interest in pursuing the matter given that the arrangement benefited my position. How I understood it during my time was (might be inaccurate):

* The Council, as a totality, is concerned with all student members. They discuss things sporadically. The duration between successive meetings can span up to months.
* ACCs and NACCs are more concerned with things happening within their student sections. They primarily run events for their own members.
* Exco is concerned with all ‚Äú26,000 undergraduate students of NTU‚Äù and counting. They implement the decisions of the Council, kind of. They organise events for and represent everyone. They are the closest point of contact to the NTU management.

(If you‚Äôre wondering about the postgraduate students, they‚Äôre covered by another group entirely irrelevant to this discussion - the Graduate Students‚Äô Association \[GSA\]. There are also the non-constituent clubs, which are the smaller clubs catering to more specific interests.)

When I write about it that way, there seems to be an overlap between Council and Exco. Hmm. The Council makes some decisions, but the Exco makes others, though the Exco is responsible for most of the legwork. Another interesting factoid: the current Constitution says that the Council ‚Äúhas the power to‚Äù exercise control over the Executive Committee. I am not sure how it works in practice.

I digress. Back to the electoral process.

Again: The SU Executive Committee is not elected by the students. The Union *Council* is elected by the *students*. The Executive Committee is elected *by the Council*.

There are two ‚Äúlevels‚Äù of elections happening here.

* The first election, at the NACC/ACC level. Students vote here for the Committee Members *of their NACC/ACC Club.* This is what you vote for on Union Day. The President of the ACCs at this level - and only the President, not other committee members - becomes a Council Member. For NACCs, two (President and VP/Hon Gen) become Council Members.
* The second election, at the council level. Council members, empowered by students as representatives of their clubs, vote here to decide which specific council members become members of the *Executive Committee.*

In other words, students do *not* elect anyone in the Executive Committee. The *Presidents* of their Clubs do.

A more concrete example to illustrate - myself. Students elected me as the Union Representative of the School of Social Sciences, and I became a Council Member. (That, or at least a temporary member who could stand for elections in the Council. The definition of a Union Representative is wonky.) Then, I was voted in by the 28th Council Members to become a member of the Executive Committee. If by any chance the Union Rep is not elected due to lack of confidence or a contesting candidate winning, they are required to resign from the Council basically immediately. In case I get questions on this, yes, my role was uncontested.

I noticed a lot of fanfare on the ground over students being unable to directly elect the Exco. Note that this election process is neither unfair nor problematic per se. The Prime Minister of Singapore is chosen similarly. The Prime Minister is defined as the leader of the Parliament, and the leader is decided through a ‚Äúconsensus among peers‚Äù involved. The voting public has limited influence over the final decision of who is selected as the PM - though, of course, it can have its preferences, and its opinions are sought by the government. A Mothership video explains it better than me¬†[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2RQTB5Qq90)¬†(unfortunately).

By the way, I can‚Äôt find the past Students‚Äô Union Council Rally meeting minutes. The¬†[election archives](https://www.ntusu.org/election-archives)¬†(which I had to google to find and which doesn‚Äôt seem directly accessible from the main NTUSU website) only have the results of the ACC/NACC-level elections. If anyone can find the past Council meeting minutes, please leave a comment below, thanks. It is 5:51 a.m., and I am not in the headspace to search for gold in the desert.

## What the Students‚Äô Union really was: The Exco and its Jurisdiction

I learned following my successful election that there were limits to my power. To give some perspective, I guess my role at that time is the equivalent of the current Public Relations Executive in AY2022/23. I had to report to my Vice-President, who was accountable for my actions; they had to report to the President, who was accountable for *our* actions. The President, in turn, was accountable to stakeholders with various interests.

I don‚Äôt want or need to elaborate on how the Union is aligned vis-√†-vis the university management regarding decision-making. I am sure there are plenty of posts out there that can paint a picture for you. I *will* say that the Union is dedicated to protecting the peace of the status quo. This is hardly surprising; it would be surprising if it were anything else.

My role was mainly limited to communicator¬†*ex post facto*¬†rather than decision-maker, given the limits of my power. So I¬†*could*¬†consolidate feedback and¬†I¬†*could*¬†attempt to persuade, but I had no say in the final decisions made.

One of my first projects was consolidating feedback via Union channels. As I promised in my rally, mind you! The hot topic that year was the issue of being unable to see the results of your S/Ued options, unlike NUS‚Äôs practice.

Ultimately,¬†[this was the end result](https://u-insight.com/2018/10/25/what-is-ntusu/)¬†we communicated to students. Relevant extract copied below.

Context: the bolded sentence is a question asked by a student we received via our newly released feedback channel. We gathered recurring themes and officially responded to them via our editorial website, U-Insight (responses in point form below the question).

>**Why can‚Äôt we see our results before choosing to S/U it? What has NTUSU done regarding this issue? ‚Äì MECH/4**  
The University Management‚Äôs stance is that the S/U option is part of the broad level efforts undertaken by the University to nurture a holistic learning environment that puts less emphasis on grades and focuses more on learning and exploring courses beyond their core disciplinary studies. The University Management believes that the current S/U declaration period up to two working days after the last exam paper of the semester gives students sufficient time to weigh their choices of either opting for grade or S/U notation, rather than as a means to pull up their GPA \[‚Ä¶\]  
   In AY14/15, after hearing from students, NTUSU successfully pushed for the S/U option to be available after exams, when it was previously available only before exams. NTUSU is constantly engaging both students and the management on this matter.  
  

Note how the response is phrased. I leave the interpretation up to you, but I can tell you I oversaw its creation. By the way, the last sentence *is* true, even as it is broad. The point here is that students are given access to the *outcomes* of discussions involving the Students‚Äô Union. As for the *process,* which is fundamental to participatory decision-making‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs up to you to decide.

## What the Students‚Äô Union is, Now?

A few comments on the selection process based on my experience.

I was recruited due to my past experience as a member of a Union Committee before running for Executive. I believe this is a reasonable expectation to have for someone who is expected to represent the interests of students; aside from a desire to serve, it helps to have prior experience. But beyond demonstrating ability through your previous work, it is because you have made connections through your shared experiences.

‚ÄúConnections‚Äù sounds like a dirty word, huh? But is it really? We know elected positions in the Council and across clubs, halls, and societies are almost always uncontested. It is the rule, not the exception. People ask why, but there really is no question. The simple answer is that succession planning occurs. Imagine you are a leader of some club or society. You would hope to leave it in good hands. You are now faced with a decision. Who do you pick to succeed you?

We can argue that the system is flawed if, and only if,

(1) Students are *not* given an equal opportunity to run for these positions, AND/OR

(2) Students who *do* apply are *not* evaluated fairly.

It is hard to argue (2) because most positions are uncontested. So, we focus on (1).

Now for the million-dollar question: did (1) happen with the transition of power from the previous Union Executive Committee to the current one?

**I don‚Äôt know.** Neither do I want to make any claim with absolute certainty.

What we can do is to look at the information we‚Äôve been presented with, and you can decide for yourself.

## What the Students‚Äô Union Could Be?

Before evaluating what we have, consider this fascinating observation of mine.

The circle is closed, yes, but it is not impenetrable.

In the same Union Rally I attended to be elected, another position in the Exco was contested. Two people ran for it. One of them was unexpected. The unexpected one was dazzling in their purity, and I say that in the most respectful way possible. They had seen the club elections notice, and with pure hope, they had run for Union Rep, got elected by their students, and decided to run for the Exco with whatever they knew. Of course, the other candidate had done the same, but with a longer preparation runway. Only one of them was elected that night. Guess who won? You‚Äôd be surprised.

In the latest AY2023 Union Rally, the role of President was contested by the Union Rep of the Welfare Services Club. However, it seems that a technicality did not allow them to rally before the incumbent President was elected. Hmm... (It‚Äôs all reported on [Soapbox](http://soapbox.sg/2023/09/24/disgraced-former-ntusu-vice-president-out-of-union-presidential-bid-new-candidate-emerges/) \- not my words!)

These two examples are few and far between. Still, they are sufficient to establish that theoretically nothing stops students from running for elections, whether as Union Rep at the club level or Exco members at the Council level. Theoretically. Please do not take this to mean that I am defending the current state of affairs.

**The next question is: assuming students care enough to run (*****high bar in itself btw*****), do they** ***know*** **enough to run? If they do not know enough, can we argue that this results in unequal access?**

*Information Asymmetry, Example 1*

Let‚Äôs backtrack into the election process again.

I knew I had to be elected into the SSS Club as Union Rep to become an Exco member later. I knew this because I was familiar with the election procedure. And I knew this because I knew someone who knew this. Of course.

**I suspect that many students are not aware of this requirement.**

The above does *not* mean that students are ***not*** allowed to run in club elections. In my case, the SSS Club elections in my time were open to all, and people were free to run for whatever positions they desired (- I think!). There was at least an email informing people that applications were open. There was an open ‚Äúcandidate evaluation process‚Äù which consisted of them pasting applicants‚Äô entry forms onto big boards displayed in the foyer for passersby to gawk at. Was mine there too? I can‚Äôt remember - it‚Äôs been years. The devil may be in the details, but I don‚Äôt remember anything amiss.

But that‚Äôs missing the point.

*Information Asymmetry, Example 2*

Another thing I noticed is that the NTUSU Instagram page (managed by the Exco only, the Communications department in particular) does not list the names of the Union Representatives contesting for Exco positions. I chalked it up to lack of transparency *initially*, but on second thought, it makes sense in a pedantic way. The Union Reps have yet to officially hold any positions in the Council/Exco\*.\* So, there is *technically* no need to declare your interest in a specific Exco position until you get to the Council Rally, which is a closed-door event anyway. (This feels like the kind of argument phrasing that got the current SU PR department in hot soup.)

To be even more pedantic, one could argue that students have access to information regarding who their Union Reps are - you can find out via the results release of the elected positions via the ACC/NACC club documents. They‚Äôre just not widely publicised, so it takes a lot of effort to find out.

I repeat: information asymmetry.

Anyhoo, if we‚Äôre focusing on improvement, I would love to see more details of Union Reps interested in Exco positions being released by NTUSU moving forward. After all, if someone is going to represent my interest and that of 26,000 others, I feel like they deserve a certain level of public scrutiny and evaluation. Let me hear your pitch! Let me see your r√©sum√©!

**To summarise, one thing is clear: there is a gap between the current communication of the SU‚Äôs election/decision-making procedures and students‚Äô understanding of it.**

**The equation is simple: if students don‚Äôt know what to do or how to do it, they cannot do it.**

I would say both the Union and the students share a responsibility on this matter - the former for conveying information, and the latter for seeking information. But suppose I am right in assuming that a severe information asymmetry is present at the moment. In that case, the onus is on the SU (led by the Exco) to resolve it. (This post *is* an attempt to rebalance this asymmetry, but I am old and retired!)

## Conclusion: For Students, by a Student

Institutions - especially established ones - always tend towards inertia. There is little incentive to change what works if it has been working fine for the people who benefit most. But at some point, we will be knocked off our feet and then forced to recalibrate - who is this system benefiting? And if there is a discrepancy between what was promised and what is, how do we fix it? I can‚Äôt offer anything else more feasible, but I am genuinely encouraged to see that more students are challenging what we‚Äôre used to in hopes of something better. It may seem disingenuous for me to say this as someone who was part of ‚Äúthe establishment‚Äù, but after all‚Ä¶ the goal of the Students‚Äô Union was always to represent students‚Äô interests, right?

If you‚Äôve read this far - thanks, even if you skimmed everything. Here, I just want to share something personal. I didn‚Äôt know if I should post this or even start *writing* this. But acting almost on compulsion, I sat down at 2am in front of my laptop and started typing anyway. It is now 7:46am. I could not stop once I started. I guess I‚Äôve wanted to say something for a long time, and after a long while, the time has finally come. I just felt like I had to say something, and if I don't post this somehow I will regret it. Whatever it is, I hope students can continue to speak up on what matters to them.

P/S: If you think I‚Äôm doing this for attention - well, maybe. I could have posted this anonymously, but with the level of detail I went into, it was bound to be a matter of time before I was doxxed anyway. If there‚Äôs something in it for me (aside from more readers <3), I believe this post captures the transparency I wanted to achieve in my time in the NTUSU. Regardless, I hope there‚Äôs something that you can take away from this.

And those conclusions are for you to hold and act on, not me.

Final disclaimer: I tried my best to be accurate, but let me know if anything is false. I will revise my post, where reasonable, with credits to you. (Please don‚Äôt sue me.)

there‚Äôs a whole current of hate against Ethan for filing a defamation lawsuit against a NUS law student.

But what i don‚Äôt understand is whether the hate is directed towards Ethan as a person, or his actions of filing a lawsuit‚Ä¶. cos (as unpopular an opinion this is) it seems that his actions as seeking legal action for defamation seems kinda justifiable (if divorced from the whole Ethan ong persona).

Let us assume two things: 1) The school investigative committee did a proper job and Ethan really did not commit any sexual misconduct 2) Ethan‚Äôs offensive actions only consists of giving alcohol to a girl who was already badly intoxicated

wouldn‚Äôt it be a false statement to then assert that Ethan has committed sexual assault? as much as he had done morally ambiguous things, nothing seems to suggest full on sexual assault? 

Therefore, the NUS student who decided to accuse him of sexual assault, would be making a false statement no? which is a legitimate grounds for a defamatory lawsuit? Unless the NUS student can prove that (1) and (2) are false, then she might have crossed the line into defamatory territory? 

i‚Äôm rly unclear about this, i‚Äôm not trying to take Ethan‚Äôs side, i do think his actions are questionable, but i do think that we shouldn‚Äôt falsely attribute actions to people? what am I missing out here, there seems to be so many people who think Ethan has indeed committed sexual assault, but can someone please fill me in with the news or evidence or sth that backs up that claim?",205,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/17asvj6/can_someone_fill_me_in_on_the_whole_ethan_ong/,2023.0,10.0,

822.0,Post,17jvh9y,How to write a report (which nobody asked!),Jump_Hop_Step,2023-10-30 15:05:23+00:00,"Warning: Long post ahead.

Just graduated from NTU (don't ask the course). Only cracked how to write a good essay/report in year 3 sem 1 (by then any GPA increase will not be substantial). I have been contemplating whether to write this because I think you guys are taught how to write a report?

This post is more relevant for those doing FYP (with variations based on your college). But, I am sure it can be used for ICC also? (By now, you should be at least 3/4 done, assuming next week is submission). I want to write this because I believe not everyone is taught how to write an essay, and trust me, asking people to find out how... they may not even know what to research on in order to write a good piece. So I'll just take some time to write a guide for those who aren't sure about how to write reports. This is also **NOT** the only way to write, just a suggestion.

Edit: If say you have very strict word limits, like 1500 words or less, do still keep this structure. Just touch and go for everything.

If anyone would like, I can make revisions here based on your suggestions.

**Report formatting**: Abstract -> introduction -> background -> lit review -> research design/methods -> results -> discussion -> recommendation -> limitations -> future research -> conclusion.

Also please use **topic headings**  **and transition sentences** for your report!! These extra words helps a ton in organisation, I stand by it.

**Abstract + introduction:**

Write your abstract **last**. For an abstract, it is an entire summary of your report. Readers should be able to tell what your study is just by reading it. (What you should do to search for relevant articles, or if you have readings you need to do but no time

An introduction is different. You want to introduce your reader to a problem and get people's interest to read it. In here, you can write a super brief background or something interesting to introduce the reader to the problem (1-2 sentences max). Then, talk about it more (implications), solutions, and what you hope your report will achieve.

**Background:**

You want to provide some context to your study and you talk about the problems of the issue you are spotlighting. At the end, give a **transition statement (do NOT skimp on this)** which serves as a signaling device to tell the reader that you are moving on to the next section and what they can expect. E.g (background about a specific climate change issue and its implications)

**Literature review:**

This one, I argue, it's the **MOST** important part of your report. It is also the part where you'll bleed the most. As to how to write, you need to find sources that talks about your issue, but their studies have **gaps/limitations in them.** You'll need to nail this part because it forms the foundation for later.

To write, you introduce the paper and explain the study **briefly**. Cite a few more sources to support it (improve credibility through cross-referencing). Then, showcase its limitations, as these limitations is where a **research gap** will appear which you will **seek** to address.

So you go... source A says (blah blah blah). This is corroborated by (source B, C, D...). However, what this source did not say is...

One more thing, depending on your study, you may also want to put your **framework/theory** here. You'll be using it as a framework where your study will be based on.

**Research Design**

By adding a problem statement here, you are summarising all the limitations together in the previous section. (E.g., Thus my study seeks to... ) Then, bring out your Research Question (RQ)/hypotheses after that. **\*\*\*If it's too far down, you might wanna state it in your abstract/intro.**

Next up, state your purpose of study (that is, your target audience) and the methodology you will be using (surveys/ interviews/mix-methods). Explain and justify clearly **WHY** you want to use this method (advantages) here. Then, describe how you have gathered your data.

**Results**

Report your findings here. **DO NOT** explain anything.

**Discussion**

This is where you seek to discuss your survey findings.

Does it support your framework? Does it answer your RQ? How does your findings contribute to the literature?

This website [here](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/discussion/) will do a better explanation of what I want to say. Summarise, interpret, discuss.

**Recommendations**

You might want to suggest some recommendations based on your study findings.

**Limitations**

Acknowledge your limitations of your study. Since your study focuses on a narrow scope, there are bound to be some parts which fall outside of the purview of your report. Stating it is an acknowledgement to the reader that you are aware of its shortcomings and you understand the limits of what you're trying to study.

**Future research**

Based on the limitations that you have mentioned in your discussions/the previous section, briefly suggest what studies can be conducted which can complement your study.

**Conclusion**

Write third last. Sum everything up. What has your study achieved? Potential recommendations? You may wanna end with a call to action for effect.

**References**

Three very important reasons: Investigation, Correction, and Accountability/Transparency ^(or ICAT for short if you want the ultimate TLDR).

1. **Lack of investigation** of the incident. I can't be the only one who feels the incident is simply covered up and tamped down with zero further elaboration. What actually happened and why does NTU refuse to elaborate further? In addition, the statements given to the press were deliberately vague and misleading (I'll elaborate on this if needed). All in all, the issue is unresolved and we do not want to wait for him continue doing the same thing to others.

2. **Lack of punishment or any sort of corrective action** on NTU's part, aside from a 5-week holiday that was not even enforced and ""verbal counselling"" telling him not to do it. No help offered to the victim at all too? 

Even if he claims he had no intent to do any other actions, is it remotely appropriate for an adult man to keep giving a female colleague alcohol to make her even more drunk? Let's call it what it is, **a gross overstepping of boundaries and serious misconduct**. 

3. **Lack of accoubtability and transparency in NTUSU** . After all of that fuss with the misconduct, we have yet to hear a peep from NTU. It has not yet been confirmed who was the one who wrote NTUSU's [statement](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxfZaAhRhbP/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) although there are rumors, but we do not need someone who protects people like this in the committee. Why do we keep voting for incapable leaders who commit and condone such misconducts to represent us? Why are we [unable to vote him out directly](https://reddit.com/r/NTU/s/9xgySl8HsL), and have to resort to posting on reddit for anything to happen? NTUSU is an opaque jar of stagnant water that allows all kinds of pests to fester, and it is time to mozzie wipeout.

I know we're all tired of hearing of this, and I am too. 

I'm tired of NTU and NTUSU school doing absolutely nothing to help us until the media gets involved (see also: the [NTU homeless incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ob9i4d/ntu_hall_allocation_outrage/)) (Is there nothing they can do right without us having to resort to contacting the media?). 

I'm tired of them resorting to childish and pointless bickering like creating shell accounts to try and ""turn the tide of the conversation"" (see also: [the uWave incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/lfxw2x/opinion_ntusu_attempted_to_slander_uwave_as_a/) and all the rumors they tried to spread this time). (P.s. I don't care if the NTUSU drones find this post and crawls up here like weevils. Go do your job and better the student welfare instead of simply giving out ice cream and bubble tea.)

For those in CC7, you would know that some instructors are not professors and therefore their standards may be lower which raises the question about how subjective grades are as diff instructors would have a different interpretation of the rubrics.

I just want to know whether it is just me or are sg sellers are sometimes rude.

There's this caifan at a hall in front of my hall that I really like, I'm talking about going there everyday for dinner. Their food is bussing. It's also one of the most  popular caifan in ntu, given that a lot of people would always queue and form a long train.

Anyway, I asked the uncle for a vegetable (and since I don't know the word in mandarin, I showed him a picture of it from my phone, asking if it's available) but I think he got pissed and said no free no free thinking I wasn't gonna pay 

The other day I came back and the uncle was already side eyeing me while I was queuing. When it was my turn I picked my stuff and he immediately closed my dabao container. I pointed at one more stuff to add but he was so pissed he immediately said you, everytime, and I nearly cried man

I mean, it's my fav caifan but I now have to boycott cuz I dont want to be cursed at again, and I'm also sad that I can no longer have my fav food...

This goes without saying that I don't think all sg sellers are rude. There's this auntie from quad miniwok that is super nice and always smile despite me asking for special order all the time (no sugar).

Therefore, there shouldn't even be a vote to decide whether to release the budget or not, IT SHOULD BE RELEASED.

Why did the current president, Annabel Lim Shunhui allow this to happen under her watch? What does she have to hide?

Do you see parliament voting if they should release the budget for the country or not? By default there shouldn't even be a vote because the money is TAXPAYER MONEY. It is OUR MONEY and they do not get to decide if it should be released or not.

Do you see listed companies voting if they should release their financial statements or not? Yes, it is the law that requires them to release the financial statements BECAUSE IT IS COMMON SENSE, SHAREHOLDER FUNDS are utilised and shareholders are ENTITLED to know how their money is being used, not because the company VOTED to release them.

The Special Services Map is also attached for those who are coming to NTU from home

(I will be discontinuing the map for the All-Day Services, as the [official NTU map](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/images/default-source/life-at-ntu/transport/shuttle-bus/ntu-internal-shuttle-bus-network_sep-2023.jpg?sfvrsn=dbabb96d_0) has become very comprehensive bar the absence of 179A, and would more than suffice for virtually all purposes outside the exam period)

Do take note of the following:

* Walking directions are shown only for venues at residential precincts
* For North and South Spines, the venues are grouped by block number (N1, S3, SS4 etc.) due to the large number of venues in these buildings
* Only buildings with exam venues inside are shown as landmarks, except Fullerton Health (because üòâ)
* CWR (Brown) route is not reflected as the service does not operate on weekdays. All other routes which run on weekdays are shown; do take note of 179A operating hours

Also, a tip for those who prefer a more geographically accurate visual: the [PDF document](https://entuedu.sharepoint.com/sites/Student/dept/sasd/oas/Shared%20Documents/Forms/display.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FStudent%2Fdept%2Fsasd%2Foas%2FShared%20Documents%2FExamAndAssessment%2FExam%2FExamination%5Fvenues%5Fand%5Flocations%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FStudent%2Fdept%2Fsasd%2Foas%2FShared%20Documents%2FExamAndAssessment%2FExam) for Examination Venues & Locations on the student intranet is now helpfully hyperlinked, and clicking on the link will bring you to NTU Maps directly.

The LT was very full and everyone was siting beside each other. Also, we were told to bring our OWN foolscap paper (imagine bringing your own notes)

After the quiz, the professor started collecting our papers, and everyone started passing down theirs.

However, the professor started going through the questions, in the midst of everyone still passing their papers down the rows. The answers were even shown on the screen.

As I was sitting near the back row, I noticed that a few row of students were still WRITING. They were in fact copying the answers from the screen and changing their answers, even after time was up.

The professor continued to go through all the answers for a good 5-10 minutes.

I don't know if this is the norm in Singapore as that was one of my first test in NTU. I come from Korea and exams are very strict. We are not allowed to communicate even after the paper is done or even when collecting the papers. Our bags are placed outside the classrooms even for the most minor tests.

Is this how it should be? Should students be allowed to sit so close to one another without proper invigilation  (the LT is so big)? Should the professor go through answers right after the test? Should students be allowed to change their answers after the time is up?

This paper is worth 30% of our grade. Is this fair?

Is my exam this week going to be like this as well? Us sitting in the halls together

What should I do? I don't know if it is too late to report, this happened the week before recess week and it is now finals.

UPDATE:

The issue was reported beforehand, but the conclusion was ""No evidence because the lecture doesn't have cctv""

No other information was passed down nor was there anything done to prevent this from happening again",125,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/181yewx/test_and_quiz_ethics/,2023.0,11.0,

lately ive been feeling like im stuck with studying and sleeping/resting. studying takes literally everything out of me, to the point whr by the end of the day i just do not have it in me at all to socialise. my interests arent v conventional like football or kpop or tiktok trends or stuff like that. im more into nature and mental health, so its even harder to connect with ppl. its not that i dont want to meet new ppl, in fact quite the opposite. but i seem to keep getting stuck at dead ends of small talking. like ""oh how was ur wk"", ""whens ur next quiz"" liddat. i feel like im expected to always be this jovial, cheery, good vibes only guy who never brings his emotions into conversations bcos it would ruin the mood. otherwise ppl dont rly want u arnd. but if in order to hang out with ppl i always have to pretend thrs nth wrong besides the usual uni stress, then its incredibly draining cos i'll just have to keep masking, which makes it harder to motivate myself to socialise.

so im starting to believe i just have to grit my teeth and make it thru uni without socialising or making new friends. but its damaging my mental health alot cos i end up spending like 90% of my time by myself either studying or recovering so i can get back to studying. when i get overwhelmed i just cry in my room until the stress of deadlines takes over and im forced to study again. my self-esteem is dying bcos im the common denominator and im convinced its my fault that ppl dont want to be arnd me. that i should be able to handle my course and STILL have the energy to socialise. ironically in order to get the support i need to overcome this, i need to learn how to be ok without it so that i become acceptable enough that ppl are willing to socialise with me without getting drained from me.

all the while my parents are telling me that oh back in their day they just thought abt making money and didnt care that they had no friends when in school, just focus on studying and u'll be happy.

i might just go full studying mode with zero socialisation until i get the degree, and im just wondering if anyone else is going thru this. if so, how are u able to cope with it? thanks.",78,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/17rmemo/socialising_in_uni_seems_impossible_for_me/,2023.0,11.0,

My Y1 was fine, profs were understanding and kind, everything was basic and manageable. But ngl its still a bit of a jump from A Levels, I was told it's like A levels every semester. Everything just kinda snowballs after Y1 when the relaxed period is sorta over.

Readings are SO much ‚Äî and some have little to no short poems/proses, it's all LONG, LENGTHY texts ‚Äî I literally see my friends lugging physical hard copy versions (they're the size of BRICKS or bigger even).  And some texts can be AWFULLY DRY it's difficult to speed read and annotate.

And a question ‚Äî how do you guys actually prepare? 

Do you use audio books and read simultaneously? Do you annotate on the go immediately or reread after and do so? Do you make quotes bank or summarised essay plans? Say, out of 10 texts, how many do you actually read through with confidence? Do you (have the time and energy to) actually use LCC for help or what kind of help did you seek?

Speaking of help, seriously some Profs are such nuisance without any empathy. They gaslight you when you're sick with mc, saying they provided the module guideline since the start ‚Äî it's like I liased with the Holy beings to MAKE ME fall sick specifically during this period. They impose components like weekly journals such that on top of essays (think 3k words) you've to submit e.g. 10 journals each of 350 words AND class part that actually requires you to SPEAK UP (diff from class presentations component) aside from attendance. There's also the other blasphemous kinda profs that FORCES you to physically submit and collect back essays when you don't stay hall. Ngl, I miss those times when there's TA instead ‚Äî all the great profs have left due to Ntu's questionable administrative management. 

Altogether it makes studying English in ntu quite draining tbh. Speeding through different texts thats all touch and go in each seminar , expected to memorise chunks of all syllabus texts bc God forbid its open book , diff profs diff writing styles to cater to etc etc etc. The learning experience isn't fun at all and it's just testing ones rigour. I'm jaded at this point ‚Äî I'm mainly at the B range with a couple As, but I'm so jaded that I'm just done and unmotivated to pull myself together to seek that A. On top of that the modules I'm keen on are gone cus the profs have all left. It's just a cyclical Rinse repeat with different texts of different thematic concerns. 

I'm not cut out for sciences but ig I'm not cut out for humanities either. This uni experience sucks ‚Äî maybe I'm not cut out for it either. Just the beginning of the impending loooong rat race.  

And it feels like I'm the only one sunk to the bottom ‚Äî I see my peers all getting that bag. Those As. Sigh.",79,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/182080r/burnt_out_rant_from_a_burnt_out_humanities_kid/,2023.0,11.0,

Right now, I am doing round-the-clock care for him as the main caregiver. It's very emotionally and physically exhausting. It's akin to caring for a bedridden human, and the caregiver fatigue is setting in but I'm not complaining. My dog means the world to me and he is my family.

I know that my finals will definitely be affected. Is there a platform or portal that I can write to, to appeal for leniency?

I would also appreciate it if you could share your experience if you've been through something similar and tried to appeal. Do you know if it worked? What was the process like?

She insist on it and I had no choice but to leave the office defeated and go for my exam this evening. Is this justified, because I think it's bullcrap!

Granted, there seem to have been a model name at the front also, but due to wear and tear from my sibling's time at JC, it had rubbed off. Even the white plastic has browned out. But this is unreasonable. Graphic calculator are expensive, she expect me to fork out $100 just for a model name at the front when there is one at the back?

235.0,Post,18v9dgj,Hall (W)hammy,jjajjangmian,2023-12-31 14:56:44+00:00,"Since my freshie days, I have always thought Hall W (time for you to start guessing which hall is hall W) was one of the best halls to stay in (personal pov, don't flame me just yet). Blessed with good connectivity to food options and good room size and modern toilets. I was so determined to move to Hall W when I was in Year 2. However, Hall W's management has fallen drastically over the years (and never managed to recover even till now). Let's elaborate on this...

===========

During this IHG/IHRG season (aka last few months), I heard from my hall friends that Hall W was not participating in many games. This left me very befuddled as I always knew Hall W to be a hall which excelled in at least one sports or rec games. More probing revealed that the hall council did not manage to source umpires and/or players in time for the IHG/IHRG season which has left to either handicap or ineligibility to participate in games.

The rec secs mentioned to their rec captains that they weren't aware of the need for table umpires until one week before the actual games. This was despite attending regular meetings throughout the semester with the other rec secs, having constant discussion on the flow of the inter-hall games, and even being the convenors of one of the rec games. 

But, there were always solutions to this: 
- Ask hall council to fill the spots as table umps (since they are all in this tgt as one whole council)
- Ask subcomm to fill in the slots and help each other out (afterall they are getting points for it)

Instead, these 2 options were claimed to be not possible because it was said that ""it would be too late to ask anyone to help given such short's notice"".

===========

For context, Hall W had implemented some new positions this year that got me (and my friends) super confused at the need for it.

1. They had increased their rec secs frm one to two. This meant the workload could be shared between two people (or so you thought...)
2. They created new rec subcomm positions (apart from the captains). Honestly, I only hear their work being to enforce ""attendance-taking"" for rec games and that's about it (they don't even participate in the rec game that they are attached to btw lmao)

All these measures did not help but even exacerbated the entire situation. One of the rec secs had booked a trip during the December holidays and claimed that it was booked before he/she was even elected into the hall council. So this left us wondering that this rec sec took the position up, get hall pts and then just passes all work to the other rec sec (IHRG supposed to be their main job for the whole year btw).

But before you pity the other rec sec, the other rec sec also had his/her own commitments during IHRG and so he/she wasn't even available to ump for some days in IHRG. This was why some rec games couldn't proceed because Hall W's players boycotted as they did not want to be disadvantaged and penalized for not having enough table umps. Mind you that these rec games had enough players to be fielded as a team.

The two rec secs (and hall council) couldn't enforce the subcomm (in pt 2) to empty their time out during the holidays to help just to table umpire due to them not having given enough notice (and also they themselves not being available). In the end, I heard they couldn't even provide enough table umps for the few rec games that they were participating in. Thankfully, the players weren't penalized on it and still went on to achieve some results despite the setbacks.

===========

Let alone the rec games, apparently the hall couldn't field enough players for soccer (which was one of, if not, the hall's strongest sports two years back). So what is the hall council actually doing? AITA for being so triggered? ü§î

P.S: had to post this on NYE because saw them posting their hall council photos and was reminded of this. nevertheless, happy new years to everyone :)",61,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/18v9dgj/hall_whammy/,2023.0,12.0,

I think what most girls look for in a guy is someone who is comfortable in their own skin, of course not in an obnoxious kind of way. 
Treat her like how you would want someone else to treat your sister/ female friend you care about.

Boundaries are important too my guy. Respect that and girls will feel safe around you. Even if it means being seen as a lame person or a simp by other people. 

And there‚Äôs also much value in being forthcoming about your intentions. I‚Äôm sure women appreciate that once done well. 

Other than that take care of yourself and your family too. A lot of the so called rizz in my personal opinion isn‚Äôt oozing simply from one‚Äôs own pores but it‚Äôs greatly reflected in how they treat the people in their lives.

Also it be good to do some self searching, so you know thyself and your shortcomings so they don‚Äôt catch you off guard.
Especially your own value system so you don‚Äôt make regretful mistakes in a split second of misjudgement that you‚Äôve to bear with the rest of your life

It‚Äôs oke to not be perfect. The right one for you will stay eventually.

I've had so many nasty interactions with people since I started uni that have legitimately left me confused. I genuinely do not understand how most people's default response is to be an absolute A\*\* hole.

Text someone new? They don't respond or at best take a couple of days/weeks to get back to you.

Person you're acquainted or friends with sees you? Doesn't greet you nor respond to your greeting.

Meet a person you get along REALLY well with online? Turns out they never learned to use their vocal chords. Oh and God forbid you ask them to do something unthinkable like get lunch with you or hang out after class nooooo. Apparently that's the equivalent of releasing mustard gas on all their blood relations.

Ask someone in your group to do work? They either half a\*\* it or do nothing.

Ask someone to keep their commitments? Oops guess they had to go to the zoo or something and now you're a man down for your project

Petty argument or mild discomfort? Ghost or block.

I used to think I just had the luck of a guy that got hit by lightning 7 times in a span of 10 minutes, but turns out a lot of my friends have run into such unsavoury characters themselves with makes me ask: WHAT IS UP WITH PEOPLE?

Has covid really f\*\*ked us up so much? Has an over dependence on texting ruined everyone's social skills? Seriously, I cannot tell you how many people I've run into who I've texted for hours and hours, but if they see me in person they can't muster up the courage to say ""hi"".

No one seems to care about their interpersonal relationships with other people. They literally just be a d\*uche and don't care about the consequence. Since when has the default response to meeting a new person been being mean to them? Not responding to their texts? Not finishing your part of the work? Not delivering on your promises?

Do people not care that other people think they are grade A d\*uchebags anymore? Or is this how things have always been and I've just been brought up differently? I swear, if my mama caught me acting like some of y'all she'd whoop my a\*\* in public.

For the life of me I can't understand how being polite to someone you just met is NOT the default response

I can't understand how people you know and who see you don't greet you or respond to your greeting

I can't understand how people take 2 weeks to get back to you when you need help or just leave you on read but then shamelessly text you when they need something

I can't understand how a person can make commitments then back off last minute with some bs excuse like ""sorry my friends asked me if I want to go join them for a bbq so I cant help you guys with the project""

Someone please help me understand this. I don't even know if this is like culture shock or something or if high iq translates to low eq, but regardless I am so done with people. I am so so so done.

tldr: in a 2year situationship, finding ways to get him to confess and take it seriously

I've been in a situationship with a guy for over 2 years now, but he hasn't officially labeled us as a couple. we do all couple things when we meet, such as tying my hair, spending NYEs picnic together, star gazing, and frequent weekend meetups. we have both graduated from NTU btw! Despite this, he introduces me as just a friend, to his friends and even his grandma.  
As someone with anxious attachment, he regularly updates me about his day, transparent about his activities and informs me where he is (so he probably isn't cheating) . plus, he doesn't get guarded about his phone or social media. he probably also isn't categorizing our friendship as purely sexual or FWB, as he has never initiated any sexual advances or nor of anything in a sexual nature.

I feel he is the one for me, and from time to time subtly hinted and discuss the idea of an official relationship. however he usually brushes it off or dodges the subject completely. This worries me as i'm unsure of his reasoning behind his actions and his hesitation, whether he is taking all the time we spent together the past years seriously.  
There are thoughts that crossed my mind, such as him feeling too safe getting too comfortable in our situationship, thus taking what we have for granted. im leaning to advice i heard from close friends, such as making him jealous intentionally so he can realise and hopefully spur himself to take action. (i understand its toxic, but i rather do all i can before considering the possibility of ending the situationship)  
Thus, what are some ways or possible least toxic strategies to get him to confess and take our 2 year situationship seriously/officially?",123,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/19bavc1/in_a_2_years_situationship_how_to_make_him/,2024.0,1.0,

How does that work out, does that mean I be using Year 4 to clear my AUs, but be disqualified to write my thesis for my honours since in no shape or form is my GPA going to become 4 plus overnight..

Job prospect wise I regret choosing what the working world sees as a useless degree aka English.

Honestly I don‚Äôt even know how I‚Äôm going to get a good enough job to pay off the debts I‚Äôve buried myself in aka student loan as well as support my parents since I am the oldest child.

Not able to advise on the thesis part but google search led me [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/librariesprovider120/english/english-current-course-offering-achives/ay2020-2021/semester-2-ay2020-2021/fyp-information--latest-june-2020.pdf%3Fsfvrsn%3D9992d09a_2&ved=2ahUKEwi3np7AvcGDAxWfbWwGHToXCAIQFnoECBgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3ptWBgCOLQOwdynxLeWD2I)  

Lastly, I hope you manage to cheer up and pick yourself up. A fact that might help cheer you up is that only a small percentage of people end up doing whatever they majored in college. And tbh, I think the prospects available to English majors are quite broad.

For your last 3 sems, I would recommend aggressively learning about your possible prospects and narrowing a specialty that you do not mind working in for the long term. I think some interesting jobs might be: HR (good money if u can stick to it), marketing copywriter, PR, social work, etc.

Thereafter, I think you should try to secure an internship in the summer. And if you can cope, a part time intern during sem as well. If you can't win them with your GPA, win them with real world experience. 

I personally think, your life isn't just defined by your career! if you really can't find a job you love, you can always do english tutoring to expats and earn loads of money to fund your hobbies/lifestyle. if you like kids then be a school teacher (job security is a huge plus).

Subject: Student Feedback - Suggestion to Regulate Tourist Groups on NTU Campus

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to bring attention to a matter that concerns the conducive learning environment at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). As a dedicated student, I have observed a growing issue regarding the unregulated presence of tourist groups on campus.

The influx of tourists, particularly within The Hive & South Spine premises, has begun to impede the learning experience for students. The constant disturbance caused by the presence of large groups affects our ability to concentrate and study effectively. Additionally, the tourists engaging in unauthorized photography of students without consent through the glass windows raises concerns about privacy and personal space within the university setting.

Another noteworthy issue is the bottleneck effect experienced at the South Spine canteen during peak lunchtime periods due to the large number of tourists utilising the facilities. This creates an inconvenience for students who rely on these spaces for their daily meals and breaks.

In light of these challenges, I kindly request the school authorities to take proactive measures to regulate tourist groups on campus. Specifically, I propose the implementation of restrictions on tourist access to certain areas such as the libraries, especially during peak academic periods. Additionally, the school shuttle buses, intended primarily for student transportation, should be limited to students to ensure that their daily commute is not disrupted by the influx of tourists.

By addressing these concerns, we can create a more conducive and focused learning environment for students at NTU. I believe that by carefully regulating tourist activities on campus, we can strike a balance that accommodates visitors while prioritising the educational and welfare needs of the students.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and trust that NTU will take the necessary steps to maintain an optimal learning environment for all students.

Thank you for your consideration. I hope to hear from you soon. 

Sincerely,

[Your Full Name]

Well, you might be asking why is this fella not learning his lesson? Honestly, I have tried my best to park at the appropriate lots, but there is just not enough motorcycle lots in NTU. My lessons are usually at Hive building, Carpark Q, there is about only 14 motorcycle lots. The first time I got fined, I parked at the side of the 7 lots, just right beside the lot, where no one is blocked. And  there are also a few motorbikes that are parked beside the lots, on the double yellow line.

[Hive Carpark](https://preview.redd.it/m9798sji1qfc1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd82e60c8c4ba2f32c73ea5f293eaaa3197324e2)

I called and tried to appeal, as there was really not enough lots, but I was told **""There are other carparks in NTU, and there is a campus bus shuttle service available"".** I was honestly quite frustrated, its as if I bought my motorcycle to come to school, all the way from Tampines, but I am actually not allowed to park?? But at this point, it was fair as South spine carpark B was quite near, a 5 mins walk from Hive. 

However, one day came when I went to both Hive and SS Carpark B, but there was both not enough lots. So I parked ""illegally"", again, just beside the motorcycles, but not an actual lot, but I made very sure I was not blocking anyone. And I walked to hive for my class.

I'm pretty sure most NTU students will walk past South spine carpark, and you can go take a look at the motorcycle parking. It is always full during the day

&#x200B;

[SS Carpark](https://preview.redd.it/8qnm6z4w1qfc1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6c734207e701617b827d84ac849d2c52a9315d3)

This time, my motorcycle was clamped. I called to appeal and they gave me the same reply, **""There are other carparks in NTU, and there is a campus bus shuttle service available"".** Ya but there is REALLY no CARPARKS neaRBY anyMORE. The nearest of which is RTP Carpark, but it only has 7 lots, and I am quite sure it is always occupied by the staff. Same for Gaia Carpark.

I don't stay in hall, so I commute everyday to NTU, but if I can't park in NTU then how do I go to school? Even if I park somewhere else far, how to take campus shuttle?? Everyone knows the damn situation, wait for red bus, 10 179 buses come in a row, then red bus come, cannot go in the bus

I also felt it was very unjust, as the carpark at ARC (Carpark E), all the motorcycle lots are parked on the **small** **PAVEMENT**, which is literally blocking the pedestrians? But I don't see anyone getting fined. So is carpark D (Below McDonalds), where all the Malaysian Bikes just park ""illegally"". But I've never seen any of them getting fined.

How much are these prowlers even paid, there are too hardworking, not a single day where I've not seen a car/motorcycle clamped.

And I'm told that GoParkin is private and independently managed, so we have to lan lan follow their rules, but is it fair to starve someone of a necessity and force high prices? If Singtel was the only network provider service in Singapore, and they made prices insanely high, only the rich would be able to afford internet. 

Is it fair that GoParkin don't provide enough lots, but yet can FINE vehicles that have no other place to park? 

can NTU do something about this please?

About the parking? Or even the campus bus? Can we be more useful? Pretty sure 90% of the campus is well-educated or about to be. Please do something, let SBS take over the campus loops please, there are too many 179s.

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I've been trying to reach out to my various friends in NTU for awhile now but it seems like everything just dies out. Even my messages asking if we could have a meal to catch-up with each other go ignored. To make matters worse, only one of my mods this sem has mutual friends in it, so for most classes I have to deal with unresponsive groupmates or friend cliques that are described in the paragraph below (for reference, I'm in yr 3 sem 2 rn). 

I understand that my friends are also all busy with assignments and midterms at the moment, so there's that, but the issue is compounded even further by the groupmates I get in the other 4 mods I'm in (that do not have any mutual friends). All of them are just so quiet, and barely say anything during group discussions. They all just keep to themselves even when I make the effort to start the conversation. At least half of them don't even bother acknowledging me when I say a simple hello when entering the class. Then there are those who just chat among themselves, EVEN DURING GROUP DISCUSSIONS, because they are mutual friends who already knew each other outside of class, and I'm just the only guy left excluded. I kid you not, I have opened a conversation multiple times with these types of people I just mentioned, and at most a total of like THREE SENTENCES will be said and that's it, they just immediately go back to discussing the topic among themselves only. Fk me honestly. 

I feel so awfully lonely right now. It's not like I don't make the effort to make friends. Those who know me well will even know me as an extremely outspoken person, especially in groupwork and presentations, but I'm just running dry. I even make the effort to dress more nicely (so I don't just blend in even more into the stereotype of guys who only wear shirts and shorts) and nothing works. I make sure I always dress neatly and groom myself nicely, because that also affects how approachable I am. I make genuine efforts to try and connect, made even more difficult by the fact that I am the quiet type (with past trauma from bullying), but no one responds in kind. 

I'm just so tired, so frustrated, in an almost indescribable way. I want to cry. I thought I would finally get the chance to have some quality interactions with my friends and make more new friends after a horrible semester-long internship last semester (I'm literally going to a government agency this coming Monday for a scheduled mediation session because the company STILL HAS NOT PAID ME PROPERLY) but clearly that has not been how things are going. I have not seen any of my friends since, like, August 2023??? 

I'm just sad right now. I wish this computer that I am typing on right now was a person I can talk to. I'm dying inside. ",247,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1b27xb1/this_semester_is_my_loneliest_ever_and_i_hate_it/,2024.0,2.0,

But I‚Äôm sick of it happening to financial aid of all things, when we all know those portfolio-chasers don‚Äôt give a crap about struggling students. 

I‚Äôve been an avid follower of student initiatives like cdgbooboos and finaidfriends. The first time this happened was when cdgbooboos proposed a series of meticulous changes to improve the bus system, even the campus purple initiative.

However, SU ‚Äúmet up‚Äù with them and just sniped their idea, placing the SU logo behind the initiative. 

We have all seen how hard finaidfriends pushed for various policy changes, wrote proposals and endured countless meetings with the school for these changes.

And SU, without a single piece of care and effort, simply passed these changes off as their own in their new Instagram post, without crediting the efforts of student movements that pushed for these changes.

We need student initatives in the first place because we have a student union that does nothing but suck our school fees.

Maybe I‚Äôm just frustrated because a new wave of school fees is coming soon, and word is coming around that student union used these fees to buy customised perfume for their members.

As a student of NTU, I would like to bring to your attention the current situation that many students are aggrieved by. There has been a huge influx of tourists on the school compound. 

In the hive, tourists would go to levels above B4 and come in large groups. They also take pictures of students during lessons and make us to feel like zoo animals. In South Spine food court, they take up precious seats and lengthen queues for students who have limited time to eat between classes. In libraries, they disrupt students who are there to study. 

Overall, many students are unhappy with the current state of things. The school is no longer a conducive place for us to study and grow, but instead, has become a tourist attraction that distracts everyone. 

I hope this email has found you well, and that regulations can be put in place to properly reduce the disturbances caused by these tourists on the students of NTU.

this video (https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeRaw/comments/11qa21i/ntu_ejc_ns_peeps_whats_the_tea/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1)  has resurfaced as a result of a post that went up on r/ntu ytd, but the MAIN point is that the 'rumours' she addressed in her video weren't even about her. as somebody from her jc batch, i can attest that a lot of these rumors were about OTHER people, and when she took to the online space to speak about this, a lot of us were genuinely shocked and confused bcos she has never been associated with any of these before. more importantly, her reaction to this video was even more alarming - she went on a doxxing spree of the CHS boys from our batch, called out anybody who said her video was extreme etc. 

R has always had this pattern of twisting and manipulating the truth to fit her agenda. in more recent times, the NTUSU alcohol saga was also blown greatly out of proportion by her - she let the NTU community believe that there was sexual misconduct in the case by lumping together phrases such as ""victims of misconduct/sexual assault"" on her social media, which led to a school wide manhunt for the dude. more importantly, she shared within our own circles (i heard from another one of our batch mates) that she let things go to such an extreme just bcos she hated the guy.

and she's done it once again - on her telegram channel, a place allegedly meant for safe discourse and discussion, she labelled one of her followers a paedophilia by selectively censoring, deleting and silencing any other narrative that didn't fit with her own. the original OP took down the post, but screenshots from her channel can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13A78UsecLpe357A9i6H7IDw436PoNNNkdzPCeJk35xE/mobilebasic

essentially i think that over the years of knowing R, she has had this repeat habit of manipulating situations and framing the other people for things they didn't do. she's not the saint she paints herself out to be on the online space and as somebody who has interacted with her before and seen people suffer from her actions, i'm quite done also. this girl was our student council vice president in jc, but didn't do much to help out with sch wide events such as orientation. she claims that NTUSU engages in nepotism, but she didn't even run through elections for her previous term (you can see the 32nd election meeting minutes), she was appointed to her old exco role by the previous president. and this year, when she failed her own elections, she went on a rampage about how undemocratic and unfair it was.. kinda ironic  

and when met with criticism, she goes around saying that it's all an orchestrated social media smear campaign. come on la, people have better things to do than fake this kind of thing. it's repeat behaviour, and im glad people are finally speaking up cos this has to stop before another person gets harmed by her selfishness and attention seeking behaviour


edit: stop downvoting sis, you pissed off so many people in JC (and uni too apparently) with your behaviour you should expect that eventually somebody would speak up against you .-.",348,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bpodvu/ntusu_alcohol_girlruot_exposed_for_playing_the/,2024.0,3.0,

Just like how we're ignoring Ethan Ong (well, until he decided to play the litigation card), it would be best to just ignore her actions and move on.

More importantly, NTU's student body still hasn't made demands for a more democratic, accountable, and independent student union.

468.0,Post,1bk54tk,Misinformation on reddit ,yearningpoet,2024-03-21 12:15:23+00:00,"In the view of recent Reddit posts showcasing a write-up on whiteboard at ADM student lounge and the drama stirred by it, and a few other things I've realised people really like to spread things without ever investigating the context or actually understanding the issue. 

So as posted by one of the reddit users earlier, the full or the"" before erased "" version of the whiteboard writeup, a person, who was NOT from ADM decided to stir up trouble by writing completely defactual and questionable things on the board to which students decided to write a satirical response to it and named it ""Misandrist Manifesto"". When people purposefully try to cause issues , it is obvious that people will retailate in the same font. 

Don't expect people to just deal with bs silently. Somehow, the moment there is a reaction provoked, suddenly the retaliators are the villains. Now the op who posted this doesn't seem to be from Adm , which is weird because these kind of spaces are only for adm students to relax due to that fact we have tons of assignments and projects we have to finish at school and sometimes we need to take some rest and relax a lil bit from work. I cannot confirm who exactly wrote this but no art students be writing things up on whiteboards for no reason, the only reason people wrote it back was because someone else started it first. (Confirmed from students at adm)

Then because the left side was erased somehow it seemed convenient and a perfect opportunity to cause drama and  post the picture  and mock art students and call them jobless and use feminism as an insult against us. Just because we are more open minded and express our views more strongly doesn't mean we are constantly trying to stir up problems with other people. They are hardworking people, who stay up for multiple nights to finish their projects and deal with critiques and stress like every other academically challenging module. We don't have time for all this, let alone writing think pieces on whiteboard for no reason. At most people draw their favorite characters and write cute reminders.

Everyone has the right to express their opinions but to just come here and start berating art students because *checks notes* they are liberal, is not the drag you think it is.

This raises more concerns on misinformation and disinformation spread to defame people. Sure, it's fun to start a drama and get clicks for engagement but remember, the moment you stop verifying things and start blindly believing everything on the internet, is the day you have failed digital literacy 101.

I don't like how universities keep pushing for AI art and generative content in general. As far as it seems trendy and cool, as a creative it genuinely hurts me to see some computer generated work with no thought put behind it (and especially sourcing and stealing from other artists) be out on a big display while creatives like us struggle to get our works even recognized. They could actually get real artworks and installations from our department up there but oh well. (I also don't like that there's a generative ai art course. Absolutely terrible? What are we studying art for then? ). The more these people push for ai, the more it's likely to be used for a malicious cause.

so context - there's this guy in my wkw batch who i got grouped together with, but i was seriously getting really bad vibes from him? like i would catch him staring at other girls in class, and it was like if you made eye contact with him he would quickly look away (this happened to me a few times before).

but anyways i heard some really sus stuff about him also from people who knew him in JC and hall...  apparently he got reported to his intern place HR before for sexual harassment? my friend knew the girl who reported it and apparently he was always leering at the female interns and doing stuff like standing way too close to them and touching their waist and stuff... 

and also as like somebody who's also aiming to go into the same field (journalism), i get so put off by his lack of journalistic integrity. i've heard from his fellow interns that he would fake his sources just to write an article, or like promise his sources full anonymity then proceed to name drop them .-.

honestly im so disturbed by this and i really don't know what to do :/ i know the sem is ending soon but since we are in the same batch its inevitable that i will still see him around and stuff.. i guess i just wanted to rant cos there's really nothing much that can be done in real life :(

I often read about how well-recognized NTU Engineering programs are and its high rankings. MSE, EEE, MAE, etc are all in the world's top 10 for their major. But I'm also privy to how notoriously difficult these programs are and how the workloads and academic units are the highest in NTU.

Is it worth it? I feel like Singapore in general doesn't really appreciate the difficulty of engineering degrees. The effort to get an A grade in engineering classes are kind of ridiculous unless you can soak up everything like a sponge. A FCH score from a humanities/social science degree looks way more impressive than a pass/third degree from engineering.

The engineering industry in Singapore isn't that great, either. Engineering careers in other first-world nations are at least well-rewarded. Here, you put in a crazy amount of effort and get like what? $3-4k? I am also aware that people like to say that with the rigor of an engineering degree, you can ""go anywhere"" or ""do any job"", but how many employers really believe this?

1341.0,Post,1bdmpph,Why are ICC mods causing more stress than my core mods? ,DiverCautious9520,2024-03-13 08:53:03+00:00,"On my last sem of ICC mods currently and while I didn‚Äôt necessarily like all the ICC mods/the people I worked with, previous mods were quite manageable and work could be done well. From all the pre/post course surveys done for ICC, there‚Äôs always a question directing toward how well you are able to work with people from other disciplines, which is one of the purpose of ICC. However, being able to work with people from other disciplines, is based on the assumption that they do work :) super blessed for this ICC mod to be given 4 group mates which don‚Äôt respond to group texts or contribute to group work. The last project proposal was completed alone with one group mate contributing only two days before submission. Emailed my prof regarding the situation and the best that can be done is to monitor them in class. 

Class activities done weekly consists of me starting the docs and writing information relevant to the activity, with some help from the same person that contributed to the group project. The work the other 3 group mates do consist of 1 person blabbing endlessly but writing nothing done, and two people doing the difficult work of adding a content page, changing the Color of the background of the canva poster or searching canva for nice images to use! Sometimes they don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs to be done for the activity even though it‚Äôs posted on the course site and can be read on your own :) it‚Äôs like babysitting three giant babies every week for two hours which is getting exhausting. 

I‚Äôm not a super try hard student, I just want to maintain my grades as they are and ICC mods are super unpredictable on their own already. I‚Äôve had 1-2 bad group mates before but never as a whole group. This is really too much stress from an ICC mod. Would really like to know how I‚Äôm supposed to ‚Äúwork as a group‚Äù to complete this course. Do I just finish all the other projects on my own? You can penalize them in peer evaluation but then you do the work of a group as one person.  Is this fair to any other unlucky student who has to do the same? I don‚Äôt think the school will change ICC to pass/fail so that it doesn‚Äôt affect your grades lol 

Edit: I‚Äôm not someone who lets problems get to them easily, but I‚Äôm ranting about this because having to work with these people on a weekly basis is very exhausting and frustrating, and I cannot describe how obnoxious they are simultaneously.  Also not my first experience with people who don‚Äôt pull their weight, I‚Äôve been quite unlucky with group mates for the last sem or two but this is by far the most ridiculous one. Throughout and after my last class I kept feeling like I couldn‚Äôt breathe and there was a heavy weight on my chest, didn‚Äôt have this feeling before I entered class, only happened after interacting with my wonderful group.

Today I was greeted with this great news, because this is indeed a victory for all those who struggle to find menstrual hygiene products when needed the most at school. 

I've been noticing how our Sc at adm has been very keen in making student life livelier and I believe so much is being done to make things easier for us by SC and the school too! 

Here's some ways our Adm student council has helped us enrich student lives !


- **Adobe Creative Suite License**: After multiple requests and discussions with the school, all of adm finally recieved it's educational adobe license accessible to all students thanks to continued efforts from SC and students alike. This has deeply impacted us in a positive way and as the first batch who recieved this benefit , truly grateful for how it helped make our lives a bit easier by having  Adobe applications on our own devices.

- **Adm Student Lounge** : I've come to know that perhaps we are one of the only schools to offer a lounge space. The lounge is a space for students with fridge and microwave, couches and magazines/books to read to relax and chill in a separate space. Because adm students are notorious for staying at school for long periods of time due to project works, it's cool that we actually have a space to relax and unwind quietly. 

- **Semester events and bazaar** : Truly amazing how despite of how busy work gets , we still manage to have events like Halloween and Valentine's, Start of sem bazaar, welfare day, and other interesting events with amazing performances to cater to a vibrant campus life at adm. Not only does it provide an opportunity to give entrepreneurial students to sell their works but also engages us with activities that can help us take a break from work and assignments.

Thank you Sc! For working endlessly to make events be successful! If you guys are interested, pop by our Halloween event next sem, where there would be music and other cool things to see!


I'm not in the maincomm for SC but I just thought other departments could see and appreciate and perhaps be inspired by the work done by them. Let this be a reminder that students can impact and make lives easier, if the right people are in power! So don't hesitate to raise concerns!

275.0,Post,1c1jouy,"NTU Climbs On QS Subject Rankings, Down On Overall",ResolutionFrosty5128,2024-04-11 16:39:24+00:00,"What are your thoughts? Some highlights:

1. NTU had 10 subjects ranked in the top 10, up from 5 in 2023. NTU had 34 subjects in the top 50 and 45 subjects ranked overall.
2. The ten subjects in the top ten are Chemical engineering, Chemistry, Civil and structural engineering, Communication and media studies, Computer science and information systems, Data science and artificial intelligence, Education, Electrical and electronic engineering, Library and information management, Materials science.
3. In overall ranking NTU slipped from 12th in 2022, to 19th in 2023, to 26th in 2024.
4. The components of the overall ranking that were strongest were International Faculty (100), Academic Reputation (99.4) and Citations Per Faculty (94.4).
5. The weakest rankings were in Employment Outcomes (68.4), Employer Reputation (67.1) and International Research Network (66.1).
6. NTU continues to be the top young university (defined as a university established less than 50 years ago) in the world.

Common discussion points:

1. Research vs Teaching (or student vs faculty): How to better do it? Research is the foundation of the university, you don't want to be studying at a uni which sucks at research. But a university also has to teach. NTU implemented student surveys which make up a big part of prof performance. Should NTU fire a great researcher if he's a disinterested teacher, or hire dedicated teachers who don't do much research?
2. Bad Employment Outcomes: Do you feel NTU doesn't prepare you for interviews and real world job prospects?
3. Coursework: The ICC mods are generally unpopular, students are either OK with them or don't like them. How would you change your curriculum?
4. Young University Syndrome: NTU at 33 years old is, relatively speaking, extremely young. Our age means our alumni network is much smaller, our endowment fund much smaller and less people know about us. Is our youth a handicap, or should we not be resting on our laurels and be even more aggressive in improving?
5. Rankings Are Bad: Rankings are artificial KPIs that should not be what a university is about.

My own 2 cents is that its all about incentive systems and maximising individual choice, instead of top down decision making:

1. Knowledge First: NTU needs to incentivize discovering new and interesting knowledge to the point it should be the sole mission of a university. BUT history has shown that teaching is part of research. 95% of Nobel/Fields/Turing prizes are given to people at orgs that both research and teach (unis), instead of just research. Young students/PhDs ask important, often overlooked questions, and make discoveries of their own in the future. Give resources and positions to intelligent, curious people and let them take it from there.
2. Be Smarter With Teaching: But that being said NTU needs to optimize. We have no undergrad TAs and a handful of grad TAs. This puts massive burden on the professors. You should have TAs answering basic questions about definitions and clearing up basic misunderstandings + software spaced repetition homework for fundamentals. Professor interaction is key to learning and passing down knowledge, but should be used to have higher level discussions which are stimulating to both student and teacher. Profs have more time to research, students get more engagement, undergrad makes money as TAs, everyone is happy.
3. Long term student surveys: Students should really be surveyed some time ***after*** how good a class is. The single metric by which classes should be judged is how impactful what they learnt (or didn't learn) is, whether in research or industry. Instant post-sem surveys can only find basic problems like unresponsive professors.
4. 10%-20% industry guided curriculum: We need more than just old textbook theory. We need top talent from industry not just suggesting, but designing and dictating what we should learn. Not some nonsense about multi disciplinary studies like a whole mod on healthy living. Many vital skills are taught non academic and taught by profs with almost zero exp in it - web dev for example, or backend computer systems. NTU should hire top people in the specific fields either as full time or consultants to build a curriculum.
5. Building and Doing: There's fundamentals you need to learn, but after Y2 onwards students should be building and doing interesting things, either with industry, clubs, profs, startups or open source projects. Whether its intl competitions or personal projects, NTU needs to allocate far more resources, mentorship and attention to these to build both culture and generational knowledge passing. Its crazy that our competitive programming club isn't even formally recognised, its a prof and a handful of students doing their own things while NUS has a whole module on competitive programming. We should minimally have formal clubs for all fields of the international STEM competitions. Employers are waking up to how GPA is a useless metric. Companies want to see and talk about actual projects or achievements, not what grade you got. If you leave uni and try to look for a job with only a piece of paper, you're dead.
6. Young University Syndrome: I've even seen people from NUS saying it is young at 118 years old (by comparing to unis like Oxford). It affects where we are but not the rate of change. Frankly our improvement halted or even worsened under Subresh's tenure. But it's also an opportunity to build a dynamic, aggressive and forward looking org. If NTU descends into bureaucratic, slow thinking, we will just be the same 100 years from now. That said when you grad I want to plug donating to NTU. Not only do you get generous tax benefits (subtract 2.5x donation value from taxable income), but the government will add another 1.5 dollars for every 1 dollar you donate. Larger endowment fund = more returns from investment = more invested in future students and researchers.",145,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1c1jouy/ntu_climbs_on_qs_subject_rankings_down_on_overall/,2024.0,4.0,

Will your roommate listen? Given that he is the type to do these things in the first place (cb behaviour), probably not. You can still try, but if I were you, I'd ask in writing (Telegram) first, bringing up his actions. That way, if he refuses to change his behaviour, you might be able to get hall office to blacklist him from double rooms. Doesn't help you but helps his future hallmates.

About 5 minutes later, a gentleman from a certain country (iykyk) came and told me someone was seated here. I told him what I thought above and he left. That file must‚Äôve been his because a while later, he returned to the same area, had a little temper tantrum and threw that same file and now a packet of wet tissue on another empty table and muttered something under his breath as he stormed off to another area.

but in any case, the main point is this: by saying ‚Äúi‚Äôll drop all police investigations‚Äù, it suggests that a police report has been made. when a police report has been made, even if the victim does request for cessation of police investigation or dropping of charges, it‚Äôs not up to the victim to decide. when a criminal wrong is alleged, it is a wrong committed not only against the victim, but also against the state. the police may choose to investigate if they suspect a crime has been committed, and thereafter make recommendations to AGC. AGC will then review the case, and choose to press charges or drop the case - they have discretion over the matter (Art 35(8) of Constitution). victim more or less has no say in the proceedings after the report has been made. 

if anything, this appears to be a scare tactic. but then again, i‚Äôm just a ppga dropout scrolling reddit at 0300hrs and seeing the familiar 4 letters of my course again just got me fully awake, and should not be taken seriously. i will not flatter myself (i think ppga students will get the reference).",119,0,,2024.0,4.0,

(comparing info from google docs guy, deleted threads, and mods)",depetir,2024-04-01 10:18:59+00:00,"**TLDR** : Two things can be right at once. I was inclined to believe the google docs guy was in the right, in which case ruot should apologise, but his avoidance at specific points is not inspiring any confidence. NTUSU people riding on this to push their unrelated agenda of winning over public opinion of ethan, even before the court hearing results are out, using numerous fake accounts, are definitely in the wrong. Even when or if the google docs guy is right, this behaviour (death threats, doxxing) does not do either him nor ruot justice. This behaviour is very unbecoming of SU leaders especially when they are supposed to be holding an important position and should be held to a higher standard.

NTUSU exco seems to be so free these days. Can you tell us what's actually going on now instead of hiding behind day-old accounts claiming to be a [comm member](https://www.reddit.com/u/BookkeeperOk5641/s/gSpsGclbkC) and [WSC member claiming to have some emails of her](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1brbnck/comment/kxcznnj/?share_id=rx-yXTS17XIwzUuYhtqxK&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) and [someone who's so eager to absolve the ong lai of responsiblity](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bpym58/comment/kx2qpzp/?share_id=3arFd4MZGuOKsllj_Tcci&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) and an [SSS student](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/Wd3SqK2jLO) and even one [claiming that she deserved it because of what she wear and it is normal to get your friends drunk without their consent](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/NTU/comments/1bps2bd/removed_by_reddit/)?

**All of these comments are from accounts that are newly created!**

Can we actually wait until the court results come out instead of making so many new accounts to, presumably, manipulate public opinion? Big difference between using already-existing anonymous accounts and making a lot more to make your own opinion look like the majority.

And why need to post the same thing from [so](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/2bq7KVmXVZ) [many](https://www.reddit.com/user/Heavy-Address-2135/) [different](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bpym58/ruots_online_behaviour/) accounts? **Pretty obvious that same guy owns multiple accounts here.**

As for the guy who wrote the google doc, he messaged me after I made [the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bpwpjr/how_is_this_a_real_channel/) pointing out that there were fake accounts and asked for clearer screenshots. He messaged me all the screenshots saying ""come I have nothing to hide"" and then, while I was reading through them, deleted them all and said ""why so quiet? Come ask away"" and then sent the screenshots again. Fine, I continued reading.

At this point I was thinking maybe he was right. Asked him got any screenshots of the group chat before that conversation so I know it isn't another fake channel. He sends none.

I then asked him if he had screenshots of ruot posting his name, because she posted his name front and center right? He had none. Apparently she didn't even post his name there.

Then he said after that her friends came to message him through finding his username on the channel. I asked him for screenshots of what they said to him? Did they say a lot of nasty stuff? Then he didn't send any.

Because he mentioned that NTUSU messaged him, I asked what it that conversation is about, and he just up and deleted every single message. You know screenshots exist right? You said you had nothing to hide right? Dude just said said never mind ""I don't need you to believe me"". Look, **I wanted to believe him but this behaviour of...avoiding/not being able to send anything beyond what is posted is not helping his case.**

For those potentially saying these screenshots are out of context, the conversation is relatively long and you are free to DM me for the full conversation with the names censored.

**Honorable mentions:**

[Guy who called her a slut and then said she too ugly to be slutshamed and then said she victimises herself for posting the video of exactly what they said](https://www.reddit.com/user/InformalPsychology11/)

Person who [was among those who promoted the AI girl which is an SU initiative](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/lY8ZTEgRjb] is also one of the people who's been making repeated posts of ruot, despite seeming like they hated SU for a few posts. 

[Person here seems like they asked her to k*ll herself and refused to delete it until she apologise to NTUSU](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bps2bd/comment/kwxteaf/) which I feel is very unbecoming of NTUSU leaders. They're not even trying to hide who they are now? Also, mods have confirmed that [there were a lot more death threats towards her than Ethan that they had to delete](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bsufds/comment/kxi8fwz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). I don't even remember seeing random anons do it, but **SU leaders especially should not be doing this!**

One other bit of information, but the google docs guy is interning at the same place as ethan is. Tinfoil hat moment or not, I will let yall decide...

Lastly, let me remind you all again of SU's [history](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/Jd5UyCxPWV) of [astroturfing](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/ONnyqoIrcP) and [outright lying about their own achievements](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/mUzxlz12oh) and [using a fake throwaway account to make up excuses of ""not having a platform therefore NTUSU must stay silent""](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/2ZRvp07GeQ) since 2021 or maybe even earlier. NTUSU does not exactly have a clean track record. 

Again, I must re-emphasise that I do not know any of them in real life. I will not support the behaviour from ruot if it were real, but the main problem is with the NTUSU people who have absolutely no link to this incident. They are going too far and are just using this incident to give eaten more credit, all while doxxing and sending death threats using multiple burner accounts.",76,32,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bszzlm,2024.0,4.0,

pls la if they already increased hall fees by such a large %, now they downgrade the basic stuff, even mrt/hawker centre/park connector toilet paper better

as someone who shits alot (or is full of shit) this is unacceptable.

if you say bidet >> toilet paper not wrong, but i dont like having wet underwear every time i shit, anyway most of the toilets dont even have bidet lol

side note all 4 toilet bowls in my toilet the seat is loose, can literally be brought out of the toilet - reported to onestop/hall office, they just closed it as ""fixed"" with no comments whatsoever

in fact they seem to have become better friends, in my absence, and while i was suffering. And i really dont know what to do other than to just get used to it and try to push through but some days it just gets very hard to do so. it really hurts to see that the people that i cared about, really dont seem to give any thoughts for me and would rather just spend their time within themselves. its like my company was just out of convenience or smth.

I previously posted a thread about how I got stuck with a group of people who don't do anything for group work and had to complete all the assignments on my own. We're nearing the end of the semester and I had to communicate with my professor because one of them took the work that I spent three days on and did an alternate version with my content. On one hand, I'm pissed that a good portion of my work was just scrapped like this, but on the other I also acknowledge there are some merits to what the other person has done. The issue is that this second version does not align with certain requirements of the assignment.

I got stuck on how to proceed from here because I can't force my choice on the group so I decided to consult my professor. Throughout the call, something my professor kept repeating was ""the mechanism"" and I didn't process what it meant. Took me a minute but I realized what he was saying is that **based on the peer evaluation system**, whether or not **I did most of the assignments on my own**, **everyone will be accredited** for it. On the other hand, **if my group harbors any grievances against me and decides to mark me down, I will not be fully accredited for the work that I did, while they still are.** *EDIT: this ""mark down"" scenario is hypothetical before someone else comes and says that I need to look in the mirror, I'm mainly annoyed that people are getting credit without doing work, I'm righteously pissed after doing the work of a group on my own*

The only reassuring thing my professor could do was tell me that he will do his best to protect me in this scenario. I understand that this isn't his fault in any way because it is how the system is and it's not something he has a say over. At the same time, this is the most f'ed up thing that I've had to deal with in all my schooling years. We're all paying for our education, and somehow I've paid for a semester where an ICC mod has taken up more headspace and mental capacity than my core. Money well spent.

tl;dr peer evaluation exists to provide a false illusion of fairness, you can be the only one doing the work and not be credited, so **play nice with your group mates because the work doesn't matter that much anyway**",63,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1c58cui/peer_evaluation_mechanism/,2024.0,4.0,

1. Prof Ho aims to make NTU the best technological university in Asia and recruit a future Nobel prize winner. His dream is for a truly game changing discovery to be made at NTU. He believes young people's energy, attitude and ambition is key to this, instead of seniority or experience.
2. NTU has raised the number of assistant professor hires (the least senior grade of professor) from 7 to 20 a year. 80% of new hires are early career researchers.
3. In global fight for talent, he uses his experience in behavioral economics to get edge in recruitment against wealthy schools like MIT. Beyond accommodations and salaries, includes hiring recruitment consultants to find jobs for professor's spouses, paying for flight tickets for family travel and having cutting edge lab equipment.
4. NTU likes to hire new profs based on research partners' recommendations.
5. He believes NTU's youth (at 33 years) is a key advantage and gives it a startup mentality. Compared to Berkeley (where he worked for 12 years) which has old established ""kingdoms"", NTU adapts and moves faster.
6. He was born in a taxi.

Some historical background:

1. Similar to Prof Andersson (the one before Suresh), he is putting youth/new technologies at the focus.
2. Cross referencing with an interview he gave to Korean newspaper [The Chosun Daily](https://www.chosun.com/english/people-en/2024/02/07/MNQGQ3B2UBE3TAXH7UZSZGKBKA/) where he also mentioned MIT's wealth, he's acutely aware one of NTU's big weaknesses is financial firepower. He aims to reduce reliance on external/gov funding from 85% to 60%, while increasing donations from $20 million to $100 million, with additional $250 million in matching grants.
3. Also from the Korean interview he is focused on recruiting top talent, including postdocs. Value driven researchers are the priority.",144,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1cy2i97/ntu_president_plans_to_recruit_future_nobelists/,2024.0,5.0,

Notwithstanding, the operator was sternly warned to adhere to proper food safety practices at all times and increase the frequency of their pest treatment measures to mitigate the issue. We will continue to monitor the premises to ensure compliance to food safety and will not hesitate to take enforcement action should any lapses be detected.‚Äù

After sharing the good news, I have peers telling me that ntu cs is only second grade to nus and is always known as the nus reject where cmi people go. Or that the syllabus is way outdated and a relative waste of time with poor teaching. Even worse, that ntu cs grads are not as respected by companies in the workplace even to SMU as reflected in the GES and will be 2nd class citizen in the office just like a nurse to a doctor. I also shared that I was interested in ECDS but was shot down that these data science courses are only fluffs built upon the excitement of technology boom and will soon die out and become irrelevant.

I know that my friends are simply just giving me their genuine thoughts and advice, and are not looking to bring me down. But I can't lie and say that after a while all these negatives have really started getting to me, and making me question this joy if I should put my eggs in this basket.

CS seniors, do you really have such regrets joining this course? Doesn't help that I'm conflicted on whether to appeal to ECDS as well, as the economics concept interests me plus i'm not that sure on a full blown programming commitment, though I acknowledge that cs grads can do the jobscope of ecds but not vice versa.

Add: Thank you so much everyone for the kind words and overwhelming support on the situation.

My first round of interview was 2 weeks before my 12 weeks of summer break starts and after 2 weeks of no updates, I emailed HR and they explained that the hiring manager was out of town and subsequently scheduled the final round of interview with me the next following week, at this point it was already 2 weeks into my 12 weeks of summer break so I only had 10 weeks left. 

During final round interview, the manager ask when I commit til and I say i can only commit til aug since sch starts and he said they will discuss further and let me know by this week and today I received an email telling me that i got rejected because they needed me to commit full 12 weeks but I have less than 12 weeks to commit now because this whole process took so long.

There are many post from others who is thinking of dropping out and feeling so lonely in such a crowded big uni. I was one of those post under a throwaway account.   
During entry into uni, it was still covid thus no physical orientation and heck, I even forgot about the online orientation date thus didn't attend. I wanted a fresh start and a nice interesting university life, it wasn't. I came from Business Information Technology diploma and assumed this degree would be similar, I was not prepared for the math so much that I failed both my math module in year 1 sem 1 even though math was my strong suit. I was utterly devastated and wanted to drop out. I still 'had' friends who would study after class for a few session but I just wasn't the study type like them so we drifted away. Ignoring the 2 failed math mod, I started my GPA at 4.0, looks impressive but spoiler alert, I graduated now at 3.02.   
For the next 2 semester, I no longer had friend in uni, I was in a toxic relationship and saw a semester GPA of 2.0, I was called to meet my mentor or whatever that role is (those we know, know how useless it is). I wrote a few post on throwaway account seeking help here in this subreddit, asking if anyone want to be friend or should I just drop out. I dont know how but I was just drifting through this period of time trying to stay afloat and not break my parent's dream of me graduating from a local university which is a first for my family.   
Over time during the next 2 years of uni, I was just constantly thinking of dropping out and feeling the wave of loneliness when I walk by north spine with everyone in groups or their friends chatting and having fun while I'm there, I'm right there beside everyone but the whole university felt like a ghost town to me.   
I slowly made the change to seek out new environment to be in, extend my network and get to know more people outside of uni. It was slowly getting better knowing this period of 'uni life' doesn't have to focus on uni. I hardly physically go to uni anymore and skip out on work while doing bare minimum and putting my hardest for group projects since I do not want to drag others even though I'm dragging myself down.   
Soon after it was internship which was a really great change of pace for me and then FYP came and I was glad my professor helped me throughout the way. Before I know it, I am now reading the email of application for convocation. I know I will be there with no friend from uni but I am doing it for myself and my parents to see me graduate.  
Hope one day for those who are struggling or feeling lonely in uni can push through too and somehow you are graduating as well. ",177,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1ddn7fn/not_a_motivation_propaganda_just_a_summary_of_4/,2024.0,6.0,

Yes I managed to find a job before I graduated. But I worked there for a month before realising it was not a good fit in terms of job scope. I left. I spent a few months looking before being able to land another contract job before the year ended. (both are in the govt sector btw)

So, I'm from ADM, currently going to y3, I've been in around 6 CCA clubs and participated in multiple events, so you can say I'm quite involved as a person when it comes to campus life. Here's my advice as a senior, to everyone who are feeling nervous about starting uni life!

1) **Be not afraid** : Starting uni is so nerve-wracking. You are gonna be overwhelmed by a whole new system, Group projects, orientation etc etc. It's only natural, to feel nervous and believe you might not do as well as you expected. The thing about uni life, especially in year 1, is that it's rigorous and tries to introduce you to challenges all at once but the key to getting over it, is to 
- Seek support from fellow peers and instructors 
- Take breaks , constantly stressing over academics will leave a bad taste even after accomplishing goals and cause burnout 
- Make use of resources, the study spaces, the convenient food options, events that give you freebies, just try to integrate and assimilate with the environment.
- Try to find people who share similar interests as you and join clubs that appeal to you as well 

2) **Ask** : Don't be hesitant when it comes to asking questions about courses. This app is really good when it comes to answering very specific questions about the mods. Feel free to ask your instructors to help you out, there's even a CommsCube to help you out with assignments and stuff and don't shy away from using these things because these are all there for your own benefit 
https://www.ntu.edu.sg/lcc/about-us/lcc-communication-cube

3) **Don't overdo** : We all wanna outshine and be the best. But there's a fine line with doing everything and getting extremely exhausted and burnt out from work. Don't join too many CCA's, stick to one or two per year. Try not to overload everything at once, it is seriously not worth it. There should be room for self reflection and enjoyment and one shouldn't limit themselves to just uni life. Hang out with friends, read books, travel and taking that time off, really inspires even more creativity and thinking. 


4) **Health is wealth** : Most overused sentence but the amount of people who started pulling all nighters after joining uni is concerning. Hey, if you pull all nighter one day please atleast catch up on it the next day. Don't leave things for last minute or if U do, prioritise things that are due more earlier or important. Sleep is important and eating healthy is too. Don't stick to just fast foods or instant food. There's even some healthy options at convenience stores and supermarkets now. Take care , not just of Ur physical health but also your mental health.

Lastly, do attend all the career events, cultural and art events (usually at North spine ) and hey, NTU FEST is coming back this August and it's gonna be filled with fun and multiple activities for you guys to enjoy so do come !!


**What apps should you install?**

1) NTU OMNIBUS : Good for checking bus timings , usually updated 
2) Cates ; Ordering food from eateries 
3) Intellect : NTU has partnership with this app and all students get free access to premium materials and can even book sessions with counsellors. 
4) Canva : Good for presentations, collaborating with people (you can use your NTU email for education purposes)
5) Notion : Good for organising purposes (NTU also has tieups with this )

I didn't think much about this case until my JCRC friends brought up the latest mothership article with the criminal verdict and it was so disgusting how NTU covered this up and let the guy get away scot-free? 

As hall council, hall safety has always been one of my biggest concerns. And it angers me painfully that this case was swept under the rug by NTU (inserted their Straits Times statement). 

Heard the update that the guy that committed this act is back on campus as well and allowed back into various CCAs. He even posted this awful caption that seeks to elicit sympathy and made himself sound like the victim. 

What's even more shocking to me is the amount of people sympathising with him in the comments because he's quite pops? Every single one of these people should be placed on a watchlist.  

Why do we keep giving major leadership positions in NTU to people of questionable character? And why did Mothership censor his name even though Straits' Times released it already?

TLDR, didn't enjoy my degree at all, struggled my 3.5 years (even though i'm DY2, extended another sem), had to take supplementary papers after my last sem because i failed 2 mods. graduated with slightly above 2 GPA.  
  
started job hunting only in march (yes late, because i wasn't even sure i could pass my supplementary papers). i wanted to pivot out of engineering because i was very sure this wasn't what i wanted to do as a career. i have a keen passion in business operations and strategy, liked the idea of rotation thus applied for mostly graduate programs and management associate roles! 

some background about myself: in my 3.5 years in engineering i only did one professional internship but i mentored and volunteered for a non-profit organisation consistently (weekend and weekdays) for the last 4 years. was in a sports CCA and played SUNIG and IVP. 

sent out close to a 100 resumes, but each of my resume's objective was curated to the role/company i applied. landed about 5 interviews, 2 of which proceeded to the final round and i was finally offered a MA role for a MNC :') 

nothing to boast, in fact this whole process was full of doubt and many what ifs (what if i changed my course, what if i took up more internships etc). to all those struggling in school, YOU WILL MAKE IT. a bad grade isn't the end!!!! attitude is key and what employers look out for, how you carry yourself is important. uni isn't easy and don't do it alone.

Study tips: Take down whatever notes your prof write , don‚Äôt be lazy and procrastinate ( ask your questions to prof/TA directly or through emails ) Most of them are really helpful and profs are willing to arrange for physical consultations.

Also , never do last minute study. We can start studying for a test / finals early and doing a few chapters per day so that we give our mind to consolidate all the new information. Afterwards, challenge yourself to write out the information that we have recalled without referring back to our notes . Practise this again and again, you will definitely be more confident in yourself. Don‚Äôt think that your questions are stupid because clarification is better than ignorant . 

Sometimes , people may say people who are actively participating in tutorials are class sluts but when you are more engaged , you tend to be more interested in the topic

I also face some heartbreaks in school , it affected me a lot until the point I felt depressed and no mood to study. It‚Äôs tough very very tough , sometimes we may look at the past and ask ourselves why this happen. I ran almost everyday at SRC wave in school and this keeps me motivated. I became more introverted last sem but I was glad I have the support from my good friends. It is important to share our thoughts or inner feelings with people if not it gets worse till people may commit suicide or have no will to live. 

Wah, how come all my sem in NTU seem to be a new challenge. My GPA is decent 
4.26 to 4.43 to 4.48 and to 4.44

So is my goal FCH? Maybe ? But now I am not striving for FCH as much as before in Y1 or Y2S1. Sometimes I will prefer good health over grades. Good health be it mental or physical health, I hope those who are reading these take some time to relax and chill before next sem starts again , always find meaning first before mugging so hard for grades. Grades aren‚Äôt everything, the will we have to stand back up from setbacks are what it takes that will push us further in life.

What do you expect international students who left their homes, parents, friends, and everything we knew to move to a completely new country to study at NTU and this is how we get treated for basic housing...

It will be effective from AY2024/25 and supersedes the existing S/U Option Policy.
 
The FGO aims to empower NTU students with greater autonomy and flexibility to shape their academic journey. Through the FGO, students are provided a safe space to try new courses, without having to worry about its potential impact on their CGPA. This encourages students not to be too focused on grades, but rather to seize every opportunity to stretch themselves and explore new areas outside their core discipline.

FGO allows students to convert the grades of eligible courses to Pass or No Record grades, which are excluded from the student's cumulative GPA (CGPA). 
 
Students can declare the FGO on eligible courses taken in any semester during any declaration period before their graduation, subject to the quota of FGO Academic Units (AU) for their degree programmes. 
 
After the FGO declaration, grades will be converted to Pass/Fail.

Following the declaration, students' CGPA for the latest semester will be recomputed to reflect the FGO-declared courses. Students will only receive AU for FGO-declared courses with Pass grades.

The FGO can be applied to up to 12 AUs for three-year, four-year degree programmes (except Biomedical Sciences) and five-year programmes, and up to 9 AUs for direct entry programmes and Biomedical Sciences programme.
 
The FGO can be applied to:

1. Broadening and Deepening Electives (BDE): Courses to broaden and deepen students' learning experience

2. Major Prescribed Electives offered with a BDE option (MPE-BDE): Selected courses that undergraduates can take for specialisation in a particular degree programme or to broaden your learning

Source: NTU Intranet

TLDR: We can now S/U up to 12 AUs after seeing our AY24/25 Sem 1 course results. However, eligible courses are limited to Broadening & Deepening Electives (BDEs) & Major Prescribed Electives (MPEs) with an BDE option.

Well, guess what? Every single day I've been in school since this semester started, I have been approached at least once by these people again. 

That's genuinely fking CRAZY. HOW HARD ARE THESE PEOPLE HUNTING??? I'm getting approached literally every single day!

If you belong to any christian society or bible study group that is an NTU club, and you know members who are doing this, REIN THEM IN. This isn't the proper way to perform any form of outreach, and I say that while being a Christian myself.

Just 5 minutes before posting this, I got approached by another girl who called herself Eileen who tried to tell me about the same stuff, so I just cut her off and told her that I know what she's gonna say, and I am already a Christian and have my own care group.

I just want my quiet time during lunch and my study time to be uninterrupted. I hate explaining everyday to random strangers that, yes, I'm already a christian, and no, I do not need a bible study group.

Dear fellow Singaporeans, this should already be automatic in a crowded bus. Please place your damn backpack on the floor and please move towards the end of the bus. Please!!!

Dear foreign friends, please try to take note of the conventions here in Singapore.

At this point, it seems like begging for more buses will never work. Perhaps, we can start by changing what we can control.",148,9,https://i.redd.it/l3e4yywa0ekd1.jpeg,2024.0,8.0,

International freshie here
Sorry for the rant but I do need some advice!

I‚Äôm financially poor (from a single family with lower than $800/mth income) so applied to a bunch of bursaries & study loans. 
Did manage to get a few.( that‚Äôs the main reason why I accepted the offer & matriculated)
For context, it‚Äôs ocbc tuition fee loan & another half-loan half-grant scheme in my home country.

Enrolled into econs without studying econs before. 
My mother was stressing out & struggling because of me . We both cried a lot recently lol.
Especially we‚Äôre currently facing difficulties finding a surety for my tuition grant. If no one can help it‚Äôs gonna be 40k$ per year and we totally won‚Äôt be able to afford it, and I‚Äôll definitely drop out after that,which means I‚Äôll have to pay 20k$ for sem 1 still.

Now stressing about studies& financial difficulties &mental health 

Should I just drop out in teaching week 2 since they wont charge me a full semester of tuition fees? Although I understand some fees may be charged still. It‚Äôs better than slowly crushing my mentality.

Thanks in advance!


update: 
one of my mom‚Äôs friends said they can be a surety, but will need my mom to withdraw her bank savings and open a joint account together with him(total sgd 50000 )

 I don‚Äôt think I should be selfish cuz it‚Äôs almost all of my mom‚Äôs savings. It‚Äôs a big amount.

So currently I‚Äôll be looking for other unis, although it‚Äôs so frustrating that all my efforts became wasted, at least I can study peacefully without big concerns!

Update 2:
I‚Äôve submitted my withdrawal and contacted my mentor, still not out yet tho! ",137,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1evd4kq/thoughts_of_dropping_outwithdrawing/,2024.0,8.0,

If you insist on doing an education outside of Malaysia but have little to no funds, there are options. 

German public universities - choices for english bachelors are few but free even for internationals. Avoid the private ones and be aware that some public ones will charge you. Also try to avoid the big cities, rental is killer out there.

Needs blind universities in America. Unfortunately the universities that offer such aid is limited to the most competitive types like Princeton. But, should you get in, you would get a full ride education.

The last option, which admittedly would be somewhat insane if feasible, would be to do an online masters at CU Boulder. You will be limited to the few options they offer, but, it only costs USD15k for the entire programme and you don't need a bachelors to enter. It is risky though as you won't be admitted unless you pass the first 2 courses which you must pay for.

Good luck figuring this out. My dms are open, I'd like to help if you want it.",57,0,,2024.0,8.0,

Tried to take an exemption test for SC1003, followed all the instructions, and pretested the website (HackerEarth) the day before (Friday) to make sure I was able to do the test, according to the instructions. The test was an hour long and the window to begin it was also exactly an hour; there was no margin for error. If I found issues, I could've gone home to do it on another laptop since it was on a Saturday (today), but nothing was awry.

FF to the test window, I launch the test, and the website hits me with an error that wasn't accounted for in the pretesting instructions, which prevents me from proceeding. I follow the on-screen troubleshooting from the website but it doesn't work out. So, I immediately e-mail my prof going back and forth trying to troubleshoot the problem, and eventually the window lapses. He then offers to let me do the test in person, so I rush over to the venue.

I get to hardware lab 2 and explain who I am to whom I assume is a lab tech, and he seats me at a desktop to do the test. I start the clock and almost immediately, I have another issue, and so I call on the lab tech. He tries to diagnose the problem (2-3 mins) but gets stuck and calls the prof. It takes him another 5-7 mins to arrive and realize that I was trying to edit the pre-written read-only code within the editor (I had never used HackerEarth before, so I didn't realize), which derails my train of thought. This is especially detrimental to me as I already have trouble with my train of thought, which causes me to have spasms if I don't accommodate for it properly. At this point I'm already very unfocused and annoyed especially at the tone of the professor and the fact that I can't edit that code, but I continue with the test.

The first question goes smoothly (took about 10 mins), but I spend an excessive amount of time on the second question trying to figure out why my program fails on one of the test cases, and so the test ends (ig this means I failed).

While preparing to leave, the lab tech from earlier snarks ""better check your laptop next time"".

(Paraphrasing here)

\[Me\]: Yeah. (My mind's still working on the code lol)

\[Lab tech\]: Looks like you don't know how to use your own laptop.

(I think the prof told him about everything)

\[Me\]: I followed the pretesting instructions yesterday, I didn't find anything wrong.

\[Lab tech\]: Then how come your camera like that? (The problem was with my mac's webcam)

\[Me\]: The instructions said nothing about my camera and I was able to start and finish the practice test. Why wasn't it in the instructions?

\[Lab tech\]: There were 60 students, you are the only one with problem.

\[Me\]: Which means you'll just ignore the issue?

.

.

\[Lab tech\]: You had problem, so the prof and I let you sit this test here.

\[Me\]: So you just want a ""thank you""? You do realize if the instructions were better, I wouldn't be having this problem at all, right?

\[Lab tech\]: I could have just ignored it and let you do SC1003.

\[Me\]: Wow. You really sunk my opinion of NTU just by that line alone, and I've only been here a week. What is your name?

\[Lab tech\]: If you have so much problem here, why don't you study somewhere else?

\[Me\]: Did you really just say ""just don't study at NTU""?

\[Lab tech\]: (Says something but avoids the question)

\[Me\]: No, just tell me, true or false. Did you just say that?

\[Lab tech\]: (Keeps avoiding the question)



I want to escalate this issue, but I don't know how and I don't know who the lab tech is.

I've already been experiencing other issues at NTU like online lectures having 500+ participants, leaving no room for interaction. If the only thing I'm allowed to do is ask one-line questions through Q&A's, why wouldn't I just watch the pre-recorded lectures that we're required to watch and just pose my doubts to chatGPT? I'm really struggling to understand why NTU is so highly ranked.

1269.0,Comment,1etw1oa,Singapore's Wooden Building of the Future Has a Mold Problem,qwertygeeky,2024-08-17 02:24:03+00:00,"When the Gaia building at Singapore‚Äôs Nanyang Technological University opened last year, it was heralded as a revolutionary step toward a greener future. The massive structure‚Äî450,000 square feet‚Äîwas constructed from sustainably harvested timber beams and panels. But these days, students and faculty are more focused on an unexpected downside: mold sprouting from all that wood. ‚ÄúIt makes me feel a little grossed out,‚Äù says fourth-year student Grace Ng.

The problem highlights issues that can bedevil timber structures worldwide. While companies from Walmart Inc. to Microsoft Corp. have explored wood as a sustainable construction material, moldy timber in buildings has contributed to sickness, damage and legal battles from London to Melbourne.

Producing materials such as cement and steel is responsible for about 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Trees, by contrast, absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, and when their wood is used in construction, that carbon remains sequestered. The supplier of the wood for the S$125 million ($94 million) Gaia building says the structure stores more than 5,000 tons of CO2, after accounting for shipping.

But what looks good on paper has gotten a reality check in tropical Singapore, where it rains about 180 days a year. The wood in Gaia is primarily Austrian spruce, which was used to manufacture so-called mass-engineered timber‚Äîsuperthin layers glued into panels and beams that can be fashioned into columns, walls, roofs and more.

The Unexpected Downside of Eco-Friendly Wood Buildings: Mold
The trouble is spruce has a lower resistance to mold than many other species. In a place where relative humidity frequently reaches 80%, spruce that‚Äôs not properly treated is vulnerable to mold and rot, says Andrew Wong of the International Wood Culture Society. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically a climate problem,‚Äù Wong says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the tropics, and that requires special attention.‚Äù

But such problems aren‚Äôt confined to the tropics. Desert climates have huge variations in temperature, which can cause excessive expansion and contraction of wood, ultimately cracking it. In subzero climates, water can get into gaps and freeze, splitting timber elements. Engineers must take all of that into account when designing timber buildings, says Erik L‚ÄôHeureux, associate professor of architecture at the National University of Singapore. ‚ÄúThere are limitations and challenges to each climate,‚Äù he says.

Singapore has used mass-engineered timber in 20-plus projects in the past decade, and more than 30 companies there have begun or completed projects with it. Singapore officials, though, haven‚Äôt said whether other buildings are suffering mold problems.

Singapore‚Äôs traditional shophouses.Source: Alamy
Singapore‚Äôs colorful shophouses‚Äîtwo- and three-story colonial-era buildings with ornate plasterwork‚Äîfeature beams made from hardwoods native to the region, which have a natural resistance to mold. But such wood is difficult to find and costs far more today than in the 1900s, when most of the shophouses were built.

Oil palm plantations have replaced many Southeast Asian forests, making chengal‚Äìthe hardwood traditionally used in Singapore‚Äìscarce. And it‚Äôs ideally harvested after about a century, while spruce can reach maturity in a third as long. Hardwood is rarely used in big projects, because ‚Äúit‚Äôs really expensive,‚Äù says Loh Kee Soon, a lead architect for Gaia at RSP Architects Planners & Engineers. To use such timber at scale, ‚Äúyou‚Äôd need a very large forest,‚Äù he says.

While the problems might have been mitigated by thicker protective coating, Loh‚Äôs team rejected that out of cost considerations and because they wanted to highlight the grain of the natural wood. Larch, a softwood with greater resistance to mold, would have been pricier, so Loh used spruce, cladding the columns most exposed to sun and rain with larch.

There‚Äôs little argument about the aesthetic value of Gaia, which houses the university‚Äôs business school. The building‚Äôs 700-foot-long facade curves gently, its interior resembling a giant ski lodge bathed in natural light, with lush gardens tucked into internal courtyards. The ground floor is breezy and open, with no doors at the entrances.

More than a dozen conversations with students and staff who use the building, though, yield disgust, humor and concern about the problem. One staffer says he avoids his office because he‚Äôs afraid the mold will aggravate respiratory issues. ‚ÄúIf the mold is just ugly, it‚Äôs not an issue,‚Äù says student Lifei Shan. ‚ÄúBut since it can cause health problems, the school has to clean it up.‚Äù

Mold expert Joey Feng checks for the presence of mold.Photographer: Ore Huiying/Bloomberg
The first thing visitors see and smell is the fragrant Austrian spruce that makes up the bulk of the building. Joey Feng, a mold inspector from a company called Air & Odor Management, isn‚Äôt impressed. Spotting white flecks that look like dust on a wooden pillar, Feng takes a sample with a swab and dips it into a clear liquid that turns lavender, indicating mold. She later finds more growth on air vents, which risks spreading it through the building. ‚ÄúI would treat this room immediately,‚Äù she says.

The school and architect Loh note that mold isn‚Äôt rare in humid Singapore, and they say it‚Äôs unlikely to affect structural integrity. Nonetheless, the school has developed ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù maintenance plans for Gaia, including reapplying sealant on the timber, adjusting the air-conditioning and asking staff to keep windows closed to reduce condensation. Experts in the field suggest treating surfaces with bleach, applying heavier coatings on the wood, installing dehumidifiers and running the AC 24/7, though that would make the building less sustainable.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of anywhere on Earth you could not use mass timber, if it‚Äôs designed for that particular climate,‚Äù says Art Schmon, an analyst at timber consultant Forest Economic Advisors. ‚ÄúThe disadvantage is that it increases cost. Is it still competitive with steel and concrete? That‚Äôs a separate question.‚Äù",70,0,,2024.0,8.0,

As students of NTU and/or that are paying school fees, we are rightfully entitled to convenience of transport with the campus riders. However, this is not the case. The bus stops are always full of people waiting for any campus shuttle, eventually potentially needing to give up on going up the bus because people are literally being squashed to the point the bus doors can barely close. The students are then left to watch as bus 179 arrives repeatedly while the bus stop gets even more crowded with people. Moreover, even with continuous feedback there have not been not any actions made to improve the situation of there not being enough buses to ferry the students around. 
Hence, considering the fact that there are students of 2 institutes of higher education that mostly rely on the campus riders to get around school, a suggestion made is to allow NTU & NIE students to ride buses 179 and 199 for free, or at a very discounted rate, through the use of the mateic card. This would allow students to get to their destination more quickly, solve the problem of the insufficient number of campus riders, as well as improve the welfare of the students by not forcing them to squeeze into the buses.",70,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1expaoq/petition_for_ntu_students_traumatised_by_campus/,2024.0,8.0,

NTUSU's main weapon has always been their nepotism and voting for each other, which always skews the elections in their favour.

This matters because the current union has been using OUR school fees to do stupid things like bUyiNG FAnCy cAmErAs and alcohol (the proof will be detailed in the google doc link below)

Not only that, in this past week, they've been kicking out anyone that called them out for their budget usage and nepotistic culture.

Please forward the Google doc below, which contains evidence of their years of manipulation, doxxing, toxicity and budget embezzlement, which they've been trying desperately to shove away for years.

As many of the SU roles are co-opted, he has been going around looking for successors for these roles even though these roles are meant to be free and open for all to be elected in.

To my understanding, this guy has started policy meetings (since he is VPP and aspiring VPP again), assuming he will get a free pass and elect as VPP again unopposed.

Here is my plea to all students: PLEASE DO NOT VOTE THE NEPOTISTIC CIRCLE IN.

To all ACC presidents and NACC presidents: PLEASE DO NOT ELECT IN THE SAME CIRCLE (ie Edison, Dominic, Darren, Ebenezer)

My two cents, due to such circumstances it should be mandated that the president or the vice president of the student club NTUSU should come from the college with the largest representation of the student body, which is COE.

EDIT2: Not sure on the possible impact that 300k could have with financial aid. Using some napkin math, even if 300k was utilised to subsidise food for financial aid, eg 2$ per meal subsidy that‚Äôs 150k meals. If 3k students qualify for financial aid, that‚Äôs just 50 meals subsidised per student. Which would last approximately 25 days assuming you‚Äôre subsiding only lunch and dinner.

Like you're saying that you'll never win when saying it's not racist. So as a consequence you'll just make me happy by saying that it's not racism which was what you said in the first sentence. I'm not too sure what to take away from that.

I'm also from Social Sciences but not soci so pardon my lack of understanding and if I jump the gun in my chain of logic for this. As for power dynamics and history. In short, is it just the implication that racism essentially brings systemic discrimination and suppression towards certain groups for a trait that they have no control over. And this would naturally have far reaching effects generations into the future which is where we are now, and the problem does still persist to every extent. So is it being implied that for innate negative prejudice against a group to be perceived as racism or harmful, it must carry that history of oppression. Without that history and existence of an oppression dynamic, innately antagonising a group based on race is not defined the same and not harmful.",1,0,,,,ln7fkhe

Edit: Noted that you added the part about the NTU SU after. I honestly have not kept up with it other than the group chat message. I think my stance on it is pretty generic and the comment was never really about them. It was about the labelling of the chinese race as all being bigots.

My thoughts on the situation are just that it's improper and proliferates negative stereotypes, especially for a person in a position of power. People who initially disagree with it might end up agreeing just to stay in good graces with the others in the group. If such a dynamic exists, especially within a group chat that supposedly represents the student body, it's vile.

I wasn't even sure what race you were, and it did not matter to me when I was approaching the topic of overgeneralisation of the chinese. I don't think two wrongs make a right. Just because some people in the group have discriminated against you doesn't mean it's right to do the same. That was the main point I was establishing.

,Comment,1flyv5f,Establishment wins again ,premierfirz,2024-09-22 05:04:07+00:00,"To the user of this account,

I am Ahmat Firz, the candidate who lost the bid to run as SU president.

I am not sure what you hope to achieve by trying to namedrop those who matter dearly to me. They had contributed their efforts in helping me throughout this process and who I will remain eternally grateful and indebted to. But most importantly, they do not deserve to have their names splattered across online for the proposals I had strongly advocated for. I take full responsibility for the pledges I made during my rally and I hope you can refrain from putting undue pressure on others who were not running for the election.

This brings me to another point: the election is over. I lost and I will take it gracefully and honorably. In my communication with the new President, I had wished him the best in his leadership term and I hope the school can begin to heal and regain their trust in NTUSU. 

Yes, there is time for contention and disagreements - it is in the nature of humans to argue for what they believe in and at times that put people in opposing camps to persuade others on the merit of their ideas. But, we must also remain courteous and respectful in our exchange, to not foster hatred and ill-feelings against others. The words of Martin Luther King Jr. certainly ring true in this regard: ""Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that."" We can debate in the 'war of ideas' for what is best for the school, but we should also restrain ourselves and not fall too deep into realm of despair and hatred that only seeks to divide us than unite us.

Finally, I hope you can reflect on your action and become a more compassionate being - driven more by the compulsion of empathy and love, instead of enmity and hatred. Your soul as a human deserves more than it is now.

,Post,1fav3vd,How to Smurf Your Way Through NTU with a High GPA: Maximizing Value from University Resources,According--School,2024-09-07 01:04:36+00:00,"**TL;DR**: With a high GPA in NTU during Y1 and Y2, you can essentially ""smurf"" your way through the rest of the university by leveraging the many pass/fail options available through NTU‚Äôs exchange programs. GPA IS KING at NTU.

How can you get the most out of your NTU journey, focusing on exchange programs and pass/fail options? I‚Äôll break down the ideal roadmap from Year 1 to Year 4 so you can extract the **MAXIMUM value** from your university life, assuming you‚Äôve secured a solid 5.0 GPA in Y1.

# Why GPA Matters

If you‚Äôve put in the hard work and achieved a high GPA in Y1, you can **unlock many strategic advantages** throughout the rest of your degree. NTU offers various exchange programs where you can pass/fail many of your modules, which is key to maintaining that GPA while gaining international exposure and clearing cores.

# Types of Exchanges and Key Programs

Here‚Äôs a rundown of the exchanges you should aim for to **maximize pass/fail opportunities**:

1. **NTU GEM VEnturer (Virtual Education)** You can pass/fail one of your **CORE/MPE** modules every year from Y2 onwards. YES, VIRTUAL EXCHANGE CAN PASS/FAIL ONE **CORE/MPE** But note, once you‚Äôre in GEM VEnturer, you can't do SUSEP or Overseas Exchange for that Semester itself you are on Gem VE.
2. **NTU SUSEP (Singapore Universities Student Exchange Programme)** Great for passing/failing your CORE/MPE modules, but also consider taking partial exchanges where you can clear as many modules as a full exchange.
3. **NTU GEM Explorer (Semester Exchange)** This is your standard overseas exchange. A great way to pass/fail your CORE/MPE while enjoying a semester abroad.
4. **NTU GEM Discoverer (Short-Term Programmes - Summer School)** Useful for clearing your **CORE/MPE** and also Broadening & Deepening Electives (BDEs). However, **Winter Studies under GEM Discoverer no longer allows pass/fail for CORE/MPE modules**.

# Ideal NTU Journey Plan

Here‚Äôs the optimal roadmap I‚Äôd follow if I were to reset my NTU experience:

1. **Year 1 S1**: Hardcore studying.
2. **Year 1 S2**: Hardcore studying, apply for NTU SUSEP for Y2S1.
3. **Year 2 S1**: Hardcore studying, apply for NTU VE for Y2S1 or SUSEP for Y2S2.
4. **Year 2 Winter Break**: Clear your BDEs via MOOCs or consider a Winter Exchange.
5. **Year 2 S2**: Hardcore studying, apply for NTU VE, SUSEP, Overseas Exchange or Summer School for Y3S1/S2.
6. **Year 2 Summer Break**: NTU Summer School.
7. **Year 3**: Relax mode if you‚Äôve secured both SUSEP and Overseas Exchange or maybe you can go for one of the exchange program and complete your professional internship (PI) in one of the Y3S1 or Y3S2.
8. **Year 4 S1**: Apply for NTU VE for Y4S1 to pass/fail one CORE and start your job search.
9. **Year 4 S2**: Focus on job hunting.

# Why Am I Sharing This?

Many people are unaware of these NTU resources or don‚Äôt know how to fully utilize them. If you look on LinkedIn, you‚Äôll notice many high-performing students have gone on multiple exchanges. I hope sharing this knowledge will help level the playing field and help others make the most of NTU‚Äôs offerings.

  
**Note**: This is just to inform you that NTU has these platforms to leverage your PASS/FAIL options, and how you utilize this to plan out your NTU journey is purely up to you. This serves as a possible reference point if you can maintain/achieve a high GPA throughout your NTU journey.

Good luck, and I hope this helps you smurf your way through NTU",504,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fav3vd/how_to_smurf_your_way_through_ntu_with_a_high_gpa/,,,

This is exactly what I‚Äôm talking about in my earlier post on CCDS ‚Äúfostering academic excellence and integrity‚Äù. You‚Äôre da‚Äô GOAT!  ü´°üëèüíØ Students/faculty thinking students that do a makeup quiz and/or applying for coursework mark retention with valid LOA is a course for concern (mainly because they want to ‚Äúabuse‚Äù the system to get an advantage over other students such as having more time to study for quizzes, etc.) totally missed out on this. 

My personal experience is that students who do makeup quiz and/or applied for coursework mark retention with a valid LOA are already facing struggles in coping with the content. This could be due to a series of tests scheduled in the same week (remember, not all CCDS students are taking on the same amount of workload, modules, or other commitments like family, part-time work to support living allowances, etc.). It‚Äôs extremely disheartening to see others not being understanding toward this group of students.   


NTU CCDS, you have better, more important things to focus on such as living up to your university‚Äôs purported standards, levelling up your teaching quality, content, and student engagement.

Also another thing you missed out is that SUSEP has way more slots for part-time which NTU never discloses. Ik ppl who have got in with around 4.4 or 4.5 GPA, so it's not a necessity to be 4.8+ unless someone is gunning for full-time SUSEP. Also for most engineering students, there is never a relevant core to P/F for NTU VE.

Also, from what I can tell from the post, this will only for work for humanities students, since for us engineering students we also have to deal with a lot of restrictions on courses that can be cleared outside, not to mention that we are not even allowed to go exchange in certain semesters. finally we have FYP to deal with.",17,0,,,,llwldvp

not worth to take full SUSEP in y2, as this means your GPA in NTU for that sem will be fully determined by ICC mods (ICC cannot postpone to later sems if I'm not wrong). this may have adverse implications on your GPA based on whether you're a ICC fan. I mapped only a single mod for local exchange.

the only other downside to this plan is high GPA does jacksh*t for securing employment. I personally hate doing extracurricular stuff just so to demonstrate to employers that I'm ""interested"", coz im alr putting in so nuch time and effort into maintaining my hrades. and if you're one of those ppl that do to inflate your resume, screw you honestly, coz I just see it as you couldn't fight on the same level (if you could, why's your GPA struggling?)

I also hate grade requirement for fyp for fch. fk you ntu, how am I supposed to guarantee an A-?",1,0,,,,llzgish

It would require some amount of money, if you are going on Summer/Winter schools or even Overseas Exchange. However, you can always choose to go to relatively less expensive countries in ASEAN to match your courses.

If you are on Nanyang Scholarship/other scholarships, there would be reimbursement for overseas exchange programs. I think for Nanyang Scholars, it would be $5000. Correct me if I am wrong.

Also it isn't always necessarily the best option to go to the more prestigious universities as they put a minimum amount of courses that you are required to take and also their courses can be tougher -> more stress during exchange program even to just barely pass the course, which defeats the purpose for most ppl. for the engg schools, it's actually not that hard to find unis where can clear more courses, and their min. gpa requirement is also 3.3",2,0,,,,lm1mrtx

So, after joining some ori and talking to a load of people, I can't help but feel that everyone is friendly. Like, too friendly. A typical convo I have with people goes something like this: ""HiiiiXDXD What's your name? What course are u studying? OMGOMG me tooooo. What hall do you stay in? OMGG I literally stay opposite uuuu!!! OMG im sooo scared that i'll have no friends so letss be bestiessss yayy!!"" 

Ok maybe I'm exaggerating a little but yall get what I mean? Like hey I just met you, and this is crazy, I'll give you my number, but let's not get hasty. 

Everyone just seem so eager to network and make friends and idk what uncanny valley this is but I feel creeped out. I get the importance of having friends, but a couple of days ago, I got to attend a lecture that none of my ""friends"" attended and it felt like heaven to be alone. Now l'm even more tempted to ditch everyone and just be that lonely kid who sits alone because that was a lot nicer than whatever my this is. 

Was I just so unlucky that every person I met in uni is fake? Or is there some validity in me thinking that people are fake? Can anyone who act this friendly in school just let me know if you're fake?

TLDR: The people I interact with feel fake, are people nowadays just really that friendly and should I just get used to it?

Edit: Thanks for the insights guys. I think one conclusion I can come to is that I just do not fit in with people my age.

So you were at an event (orientation) meant for socialising, people tried to socialise with you, and somehow that's them being fake?

It helps to understand that it's a new stage of life for many people, and many people indeed are trying to network and find new people they can vibe and spend time with for the next 3/4 years. I wouldn't dismiss that as them being fake. I'd say fake friends are friends who only approach you because they have something to gain from you, like academically or financially, and wants nothing to do with you after you've given them what they want.

I've friends from my OG who have gone out of their way to include me in discussions, gatherings, taken initiative to have conversations with me, cared for my well-being etc. All the while we were just having fun and not being transactional. I think a huge part of that came from the few days of ori when we got the opportunity to bond with each other. I usually go to lectures by myself because not many people from my OG is in the same course as me. But when I do meet up with my OG friends, I really enjoy interacting with them.

I'd be wary of the mindset of pushing people away just for the sake of it, because I've been that person in the past, and it certainly made me feel bitter and angry irrationally, not just at myself but also at others. It feels much better letting more people into my life. I suppose whether people are really true friends, only time will tell, this is only the 4th week of sch and it's still early.",6,0,,,,llxxc06

Definitely, what I said wasn't meant to invalidate your experiences in any way, because everyone's uni experiences are different in their own right. It's just to emphasize what other people's perspective might be at an early stage of uni, and observing their behaviour tells us more about what kind of friend they are.

Personally I'm extra careful when I can sense that people are being too friendly, like the odd friendly kind. But that depends on the context too, whether that particular setting was for socialisation or not.

When you meet the right people, they'll treat you right and won't make you feel inadequate about yourself. I think I've felt some of that from my OG which makes me grateful I've met such people. So I suppose we gotta keep an open-mind, not keep people at an arms' length away or expect too much from others, but cherish friendship when we do have it with the right people.",2,0,,,,lly3mfm

I missed 3 buses today at 9.30pm, but I ended up only experiencing a 20 min delay which means there was an average of one bus every 5 mins.

I'm pretty sure the bus drivers also feel annoyed when they have to shout to get people to move to the back, shout everytime they open the doors for people to clear the way etc, and they get no thanks. The moment the bus reaches Pioneer, everyone is just focused on getting out and no one bothers to thank the bus driver. Can we try to show more appreciation to the bus drivers? They also have no choice and they're trying to look out for our safety.

If you want to be nice, you could tell him that so far, the reasons for missing classes have been valid and it's not your intention to skip class. You will make effort to catch up and take care of your health so as not to affect your learning negatively. 

Not so nice, you can add on - However, taking time off for valid reasons such as these is your right. 

Beyond not so nice - Even working adults have 14 day MC. If you have produced valid proof for your absence, is he implying there is a need for warning or disciplinary action for simply being human? And having human problems like falling sick? You would be open to correction if that's indeed the case, but would like to see the university administration confirm this in writing - that students are not allowed to miss classes for any compassionate reasons or illness. And you will be sharing that with friends and schoolmates on social media so as to raise awareness of such rules. 

Not nice at all - if he threaten to report you again for missing class over valid reasons like being ill and private matters - you will also submit a report to administration about having a professor whose working ethics should be called to question as it might not be aligned with the university's guidelines which means there might be a tendency for him to be partial in his grading towards certain candidates over personal issues.

,Post,1fgbzq8,"""Service with Transparency""",Unknown,2024-09-14 02:23:05+00:00,"As an ex-chairperson of NTUSU who has recently stepped down, I feel compelled to highlight some serious concerns about the organisation's internal operations. There is a troubling lack of transparency within NTUSU, even among its own chairpersons. Often, it feels like we're kept in the dark about what the executive committee is actually doing. For instance, my own VP appeared to be completely unresponsive, and I doubt they ever reviewed a single proposal we submitted. The President and HGS take an interminable amount of time to vet proposals, and when they do provide feedback, it‚Äôs usually just a cursory ‚Äúgood job.‚Äù This raises the question: what‚Äôs the point of having them review our proposals if their feedback doesn't add any real value?

Moreover, I‚Äôve heard that some committees have bypassed the exco and gone straight to SAO because they‚Äôve lost confidence in the exco's ability to handle their responsibilities effectively. This undermines the very essence of effective governance and raises concerns about the organisation's commitment to genuine service and transparency. Instead of promoting ""service with heart,"" it might be time for NTUSU to focus on ""service with transparency.""",310,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fgbzq8/service_with_transparency/,,,

Just wondering if I am the only one who feels like food prices are getting overboard in school. Idk about you all, but I am feeling the pinch‚Ä¶.

$5 for Mee Soto @ Quad Cafe near Wee Kim Wee, and $1.90 for basic iced coffee @ Foodgie‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt even want to mention prices @ North Spine‚Ä¶

Are we supposed to just accept these prices? Food is now more expensive on campus than in regular neighbourhoods‚Ä¶. And we don‚Äôt have a student discount / price system?

Heck, some prices are comparable or even more expensive than stalls in SMU, a university in town‚Ä¶ Are operators just making use of the captive nature of our ulu location to charge whatever they want? 

I know this could be less of a problem for well-to-do students, but the Karen in me feels like the prices are becoming very unfriendly for STUDENTS who are already paying so much for school/hall..",302,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1f7xr62/food_prices_are_getting_ridiculous/,,,

,Comment,1fkmigl,Destined to be alone,Eigenstatics,2024-09-21 02:01:49+00:00,">Every time I see couples in school, I just feel dead inside more and more.

You see what's on the outside, but don't know what actually happens in the relationship as an outsider. You don't know the quarrels they have. You don't know the sacrifices they have to make to sustain the relationship. You don't know if they're actually as happy as they look on the outside. In the end, it might not even work out. I've seen couples in my friend groups who seemed happy, only to have broken up suddenly later on, which gave me a reality check. Yes, there're many happy relationships out there, and we can be happy for those people, but don't assume it's always rainbows and sunshine.

>What‚Äôs the point of building an empire if there‚Äôs no one by your side since the start to enjoy with you?

This is similar to leaving your happiness, validation and meaning in life to someone else and expecting them to provide it. Which is doing yourself a disservice and is burdensome on that person. You do have the power and responsibility to take charge and provide it for yourself.",1,0,,,,lo5cd2g

Something like this eats you up from the inside, day by day. I was so tired of it these feelings of desperation, I tried to focus on self-improvement. And it felt liberating, like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Sometimes I still get a little distracted with those feelings of wanting someone intimate in my life, when I see couples holding hands or giving little kisses on each other's faces.

Firstly, last week she uses 30mins and hides behind her assistant and leaves the class early to administer a survey for HER study (she told the class it‚Äôs a survey to help the school) and essentially uses us as a captive audience to try to milk survey responses. (Didn‚Äôt do out of principle as I didn‚Äôt like that we were used like that)

This week, she props up a screen with two QR codes and tells the class that people still can participate and if they want to scan the first qr. then she provides the non participants with the second qr saying it‚Äôs important to today‚Äôs class content. Both QR codes link to the same survey she tried to force us into doing last week.

Tbh how else will she get data if not from you guys? If she teaches well and she's a good prof I think the students should help her out too! And by using her class as her sample population, she doesn't have to soend additional funds to pay other NTU students to take her survey.

So lesser expenditure means her future funds might not be increased, and overall NTU spends lesser on her and in turn we mitigate another increase in school fees somehow, even if it's by a teeny weeny amount.

,Post,1fbnde7,Dealing with a clingy friend,zeph7rus,2024-09-08 02:16:33+00:00,"During orientation, I (24M) was a GL to a freshie (21M) who was initially very quiet and always on his phone. Being a mental health advocate outside of NTU, I tried to engage him with the rest of the freshies and the seniors, but I couldn't help noticing the sadness and depression in his expression. My instinct was right as he started sharing with me about problems happened in his part-time job just before orientation. Needing to juggle between him and the rest of our orientation group, I tried my best to listen to him and just told him to approach any of us if he needs help in school.

Sounds normal right? Well, in subsequent weeks after school started, he texted me almost every day that I'm in school to ask if we can meet for lunch. I had no issue initially as I thought it's just a normal meetup. After each lunch, I would meet up with friends who have the same class as me to go to the seminar room together. He would follow behind me most of the time on his phone. There was this one time where my friend told me about him following us, and had to leave us alone as it seems like this freshie has something that needs my help. However, the freshie just said he just wanted to follow me, and we only managed to split since our classes are in different venues.

There was this one instance where I lent him something he needed for an event (idk the specifics of that event). After the event, he texted me that he needed to rush to another class so would have to return my stuff to me real quick. Before I could text him to meet outside my seminar room, he has already opened my seminar room door and started looking for me. My friend and I were shocked about it, and I even told him that I'm trying to focus in class but he just dismissed it as ""I'm just a lost freshie lol"".

Now it's the piece de resistance. My orientation group holds gatherings sometimes, and I attend them regularly. This freshie would often sit beside me and as time passes have the habit of leaning his whole back onto my shoulder or back to rest. I felt very uncomfortable about it as I have dislocated my shoulder before but did not voice out as I was scared it might hurt his feelings since he's already going through so much in life. I tried to bear with it until I felt pain in my shoulder again upon leaving one of the gatherings.

I've told a few close friends about this issue but they told me to set boundaries. I would usually do it without hesitating but I'm very afraid of hurting him. However, my relationships with most of my friends have deteriorated dramatically in the past few weeks and started to see me in a different way. This has been affecting me physically, mentally and socially, and I've never felt more lonely in NTU than now.

So for those who has experienced clinginess before, how do yall set healthy boundaries without hurting your friend, especially about physical touch?

EDIT:

Took me a whole day of reflection to realise I only see him as a duty, since he's always there with my closest friends. My only way of avoiding him is to stop hanging out with my closest clique which is something that made me hesitate. However for the time being I decided to take a break from them altogether. Hopefully through this period of distancing myself from them he can learn not to be so withdrawn from people. It's a tough decision for me but it's necessary for me to get my life and relationship back at least.

Thanks everyone for your advice. Stay blessed",202,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fbnde7/dealing_with_a_clingy_friend/,,,

,Comment,1fbnde7,Dealing with a clingy friend,Visible-Broccoli8938,2024-09-08 03:09:10+00:00,"Dude. This is not doing any good for you and him. Is he going to spend his entire life in NTU seeking refuge in you and missing out on growth opportunities ie. Socialising, engaging in meaningful CCAs. How is him following you helping him in anyway if your intention is to help him? There is a difference between supporting a person to stand on their feet and enabling a person to avoid their problems. You are doing the latter.

You say you don't want to hurt his feelings but growing up is tough. Noone ever says it's easy. Take this as a opportunity for yourself to learn how to assert healthy boundaries and communicate clearly.

If you are a people pleaser / suffer in silence type person, you need to reflect on this and think of ways to be more assertive.

BTW it seems he knows your timetable to be able to cling to you?

I suggest the following -
Skip the orientation meetings for now. 

If he texts you for help, say you are unable to help him whether it is lending things or whatsoever. Just say, ""sorry I don't have it"" and always give at least half a day buffer before replying. 


Dont meet him if he asks you to. Say you are busy.

Anyway this is not a friend but a parasite.

(EDIT - If you experience discomfort with any physical touch and have difficulty speaking up, just say you need to go toilet.)",34,0,,,,lm22q8p

I will suggest you sit him down and tell him in a nice way that you see him as a friend and that you hope he can connect with his course mates. Also let him know that being too physically close is uncomfortable for you. Lastly do let him know that his constant ‚Äòstalking‚Äô is making you and your friends uncomfortable.

That being said, as everyone else is saying, set your boundaries. I know it‚Äôs easier said than done and the last thing you want is to be the reason someone‚Äôs mental health has plummeted, but that on its own is not good for him (or you) 

You could first consider why you want to be friends with him. Is it to help him ? Do you guys actually get along ? Is there a friendship or do you feel like this is something you should be doing for him ? Assuming you don‚Äôt have intentions of becoming close friends with him, perhaps you could try to talk to him about this during one of the times he‚Äôs with you one on one. Let him know you‚Äôre there for him but he needs to expand on that circle of people he can be around. Ask if he has friends outside of uni etc etc. Let him know it‚Äôs concerning that you‚Äôre all he has. Maybe introduce him to a friend that might get along with him, or something to get the ball rolling for him. I have anxiety and I had a hard time starting off in school settings too so I‚Äôd stick to one person I deemed as ‚Äòsafe‚Äô. 

If none of this works, you‚Äôd unfortunately have to be more firm on these boundaries, and if even then it doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs time to cut ties. At that point he isn‚Äôt healthy for you either. This ESPECIALLY goes for the physical touch aspect of this. 

Now, you could also just avoid/ignore him without doing any of the above things and hope he eventually gets the hint and goes away, but I feel that will hurt (and maybe even embarrass) him a lot more because he won‚Äôt know what he did wrong and he‚Äôll be left having questions and needing closure he might never get. 

Again, it‚Äôs so awesome of you to be receptive and supportive to someone that struggles socially !! But this guy, like everyone else, has to have other options for when their friend isn‚Äôt available. You‚Äôre his friend, nothing more. :^)",4,0,,,,lm363cx

Im all out for anyone to join us but because I have observed the girl to be 24/7 depressing.. Always talking negatively.. Whenever my friend tried to cheer her up, she will either talked 'suicidal' or some depressing episodes that happened.. 

So I asked my friend, 'Are u sure?' 

Long story short, the friend found the girl's diary which included all of us.. Some shit abt how she felt alone in the group.. Suicidal.. etc...

The thing is I recognise my friends' efforts to include her in whatever they had planned out so I sat with the girl in library (I think) n told her to stop being an ass because she's gonna lose them. That her actions annoys me because that's not how u treat someone who wants to get close to u...

She probably had a heart to heart talk with a guy who has a crush on her n she got better afterwards. True story, they married each other hahaha

Set boundaries with your friend by saying 'listen bro, I was cool with u until u started being clingy with me. I enjoyed being your friend but right now it gets too much where I can get irritated just by your presence n I don't want that to happen.'

'Ure actually cool on your own. Why don't u see it?'

As many have conveyed to me that they found my previous set of EWL Travel Alternatives infographics useful, alongside the fact that the disruption is likely to stretch over the next few days, I have decided to put together infographics for ALL stations along the disrupted/delayed sectors (Queenstown to Boon Lay), in addition to Pioneer. üòã

Suggested alternatives have been carefully considered, so as not to make each page overly cluttered. 

While I have tried, to the best of my ability, to minimise the occurrences of errors, there may still be some of these which I've overlooked - apologies on that! üôèüèª 

Updates to the infographics, if any, will be posted in the comments.

Feel free to spread these around if you think they've been helpful:)

Here's a shoutout to all our transport workers out there who are working tirelessly to get things (the trains) back on track ASAP - do go the extra mile to thank them if you can and spread some kindness YEA! üëçüèªüëçüèª

freshman in soh, and if youre here to say humanities is easy just do me a favour and shove ur phone or laptop up ur 

ok jkjk realistically i know its easier comapred to compsci or engineering or something but still

the whole uni system in general is so overwhelming, everything is still so new and we r expected to immediately know what to do?

maybe stemming from the stress that i missed one graded cc2 vlm (which ive been told isnt That big of a deal but still im like üòÄüòÄ) and am struggling to catch up with readings and lecture content

I probably would hate every second of a humanities mod if I had to take one

But a tip that applies to everyone, regardless of major: stay one week ahead of content or you're already falling behind (or at least you'll be at an extremely high risk of falling behind)

Don't wait for deadlines to come to you, instead you should be waiting for the assignments to release and trying to complete them ASAP

plan how you spend your time. ensure you have at the very least 1 rest day.

readings can get overwhelming, so dont read all of it at one go unless you're one of those who can understand what you're reading in one sitting. if you aren't, then think of how you want to digest them bit by bit.

some days you'd want to skip your readings. my advice is read the intro & conclusion. skim through. get an idea of what is happening. that'll be more than enough. 

alternatively, get your group of friends to do readings together. can either do 1 reading/pax or 1 chapter/pax, depending on number of readings. create a google doc & all of you can contribute your reading notes. 

it's your first time in uni & just know you aren't the only one behind. struggling is normal it's just how you bounce back from it.

It is super painful to wake up for morning lectures :( Also, if the lecturer talk too fast and u missed it thrs no way to catch it again. And classpart too, so you have to put in effort to talk in class. I guess different majors have their different set of struggles so you are completely valid.

I assume you missed one of cc2's weekly lams (?), sorry if I forgot all the terms, but I took it last year and also missed one of the lams and still got a A-, so there is still hope :D

My advice is to just plan all the deadline on your calendar and check it every weekend to keep track of stuff you gotta do.

Definitely tell your profs/TAs if you're really struggling to keep up, though.

I empathise with how much you need to adapt to especially since you've just started. Just remember that this is a sign that you are being challenged, and that this is an opportunity for you to learn and grow. Struggle well and be patient with yourself!

Multiple choice exams? Okay. What are the details that are considered important in your major? Is it the theory, the numbers, the players?

Essay based exams? There usually is some element of choice in these. Check with your seniors on last year's testing format. That will give you a gauge on how many weeks material you will need to master.

Papers plus weelly writeups? This is the best. Choose your topics early, research that, screw the weekly readings (do 1 properly enough to write a reflection, skim the rest).

And don't skip the last 1-2 classes ;)",15,0,,,,ll5dhjv

Let me clue you in on an open secret‚Ä¶ Most profs don‚Äôt care too much about class part, and vast majority of mods don‚Äôt actually have year-end exams, is usually take-home essays/individual research projects. What this means is‚Ä¶ if you don‚Äôt feel like learning the content, you don‚Äôt have to do the readings! What I do most of the time is just to quickly skim the readings an hour or so before class so I can at least get what the prof is talking about. Tbh most hist students spend their time in seminar playing wordle and not listening‚Ä¶

Unfortunately being a freshie, HH1004 is actually one of the mods with a mandatory exam (At least under MSB) and some of the other profs do have occasional weekly reading responses (like KKW and Flatt)

Your ability to follow the content and keep up with readings is instrumental to your academic journey, no? Just let them know how you're feeling and seek their advice.

For readings, try your best but don't stress too much about not being able to read everything in detail. Reflect properly on the texts that speak to you the most and know the rest roughly.

,Post,1fh40km,(Opinion) The last 2 years of NTUSU election saga makes a strong case for establishing partisanship in student government,H3NTA1B01,2024-09-15 04:07:40+00:00,"TL;DR: you all can keep talking about the corruption all you want, but a lack of any action to organize your demands and outline your plans for the school means you will inevitably never get what you want 


While it is commendable that the larger student body isn‚Äôt just going to let our student leaders lead without accountability, there is still an awkward lack of organization of coherent opinions and policies that some factions of the student body is demanding.

The ability of the ruling clique of students to still take office despite (online) protests and (amateur) investigative findings on their actions proves that any clique of students who are organised to a certain capacity will always be able to push forth their agenda. As long as a strong alternative voice to organise the opposition is absent, this will always be the case.

Yet, whenever it is actually time to step up to nominate themselves for office, the loudest voices often hide behind excuses such as ‚ÄúI very busy‚Äù or ‚Äúaiya I one person also cannot change anything‚Äù, showing a pathetic lack of action that does nothing to better the situation we are in.

I urge juniors who are enraged over the lack of transparency and rampant cronyism that has plagued the Student Union for years to organize yourselves into parties that actually outline your plans on how to make the school better, and run for office on a united front together. An opposition party in response to the ruling clique, if you will.

Learnt that there was going to be an air-con maintenance (as per the worker's words), no issue, thanked them, gave them cold drinks, went out for a while.  

Came back at 12+, to my surprise, was not just a simple maintenance/check, they were dismantling the air-con units of mine and the one next to me, and replacing the entire system with new ones. We were not told in advance and there was no plastic sheets given/placed to cover our furniture. My room and the room next to mine was already covered in plaster, no biggie, they said they would mop our floor for us, moved some of my clothes so they wouldn't get covered in even more plaster.  

Said they would be done at 4, came back, said they needed another hour. Went out for dinner and received a call from the Admin Office at 5 that the installation was done, and there would be a remote given to us for free air-con while they register the unit into the NTU Hall-Aircon app.  

Came back at 10, my entire table and the stuff on the table was white, floor not fully cleaned (still had that layer of dust on it), and air-con could not be turned on. Asked my neighbour and he said the workers told him that it was not complete, they have not installed the compressor etc.  

First sem here, quite frustrated, any idea what I should do (other than reporting one-stop SAC)?  

Anyone else also encountered this kind of issue where NOTHING was said in advance?

But make sure you click a photo of the mess those dudes created. Send it hall office and disturb them everyday, or else you‚Äôd have suffered for no reason. Demand compensation / free rent for mental health damage or smth, I think it should work.

Something similar happened to me once. Those dudes came for Aircon servicing , left with my Aircon half broken. Asked hall office to get it changed. Took them 3 MONTHS TO CHANGE. Not to mention , these guys did something with the paint which also caused my switch board to die (shit legit burst into flames) AND I HAD TO STAY WITHOUT A FAN OR AIRCON FOR 2 WEEKS.

Moral of the story, keep on messaging/ calling campus repair guys and hall office and DEMAND COMPENSATION!! BE THE KAREN YOU DESERVE TO BE RATHER THAN SUFFER LIKE ME üò§üò§",96,0,,,,lmax2qk

,Post,1fadhgb,CCDS Academic Policy Meeting with Deanery Outcome ,Faith-Creuset,2024-09-06 12:05:07+00:00,"As title suggests, I am part of the team that went to have a meeting with the deanery from NTU. We mainly discussed the pain points experienced by students with the revised academic policy from CCDS (tutorial marks)

Below are the solutions/recommendations that we gave CCDS' deanery and their replies.

Recommendations:

* Postpone policy this semester

Rejection: CCDS deanery stance is students who commit to a full time degree must commit to it by attending lectures / tutorials / labs

* Hybrid Tutorials

Rejection: Online classes are not conducive & students who commit to a full time degree must commit to it by attending lectures / tutorials / labs

* More indexes

Rejection: Lack of facilties and faculty for increased intake



Important things to note:

* College is moving towards major changes in curriculm and learning. New tutorial policy have led to high tutorial attendance, exams will now be harder.
* Removal of lecture recording is **not a confirmed thing and may or may not happen down the line**
* Exams will be harder



The pain points of students namely

* Distance from school affecting tutorial participation

Reply from Deanery: CCDS deanery stance is students who commit to a full time degree must commit to it by attending lectures / tutorials / labs

* Tutorial's inconducive due to noise:

Reply from Deanery: Tutorial Conduciveness is both a lecturer and students responsibility in maintaining the conduciveness

* Class Participation

Reply from Deanery: Due to class size making individual answering infeasible, being physically present will suffice in getting the 5 marks provided attenandce is within the specified 70% attendance.

CCDS Deanery Observation:

* Good attendance for tutorials ever since academic policy is implemented. CCDS deanery argues that students had the option to choose whether or not to attend tutorials, i.e. students are not forced to attend

Given that our petition has only 500 signatories, it is not a strong enough support since CCDS has 3000 students. Thus, we hope that we can get more support and feedback from y‚Äôall that‚Äôs affected by this by singing the petition and putting in suggestions to improve the system in the comments 

We will update y‚Äôall on our further progress

Like it gives a small exposure to put ur knowledge to test in a safe environment to make mistakes and learn. So that instead of only a few prodigies performing well in those interviews, it makes more people perform better?

Its 2024, where technology is ever growing. This is a simillar mentality to CEOs making statements that employees must come to office to work instead of WFH.

That's why they implemented this new policy in the first place. So what are the factors that contribute to incompetency of CCDS students? Well, personally I think there are two factors: school accepts a lot more students, and professors are not smart enough to teach as good as top uni in the US, that's why some student just watch YT videos from Harvard or MIT (myself included).

The issue is in the way that they are responding to the student's concerns.

They did mention during the meeting that they are considering removing recorded lectures.

And that's the thing I'm concerned about. That will genuinely hamper our ability to understand the content.

Forget profs w thick accents or needing time to digest difficult content.

What if I MC during a lecture day? Am I now forced to get my content from YouTube channels? Is that of equivalent academic rigour? If so, why even pay for lectures then?

The problem is that certain programmes over-matriculate students. But this seems to stem from the directive of MOE because they dictate how many students each programme can admit. The trend is that CS admits more students while the other programmes admit fewer. Even the overall number of students may not increase that much, a big increase in a specific programme can already put a big strain on facilities -- more students are going to class around the same time, LTs may not be big enough, absurd number of small tutorial classes, etc. The buildings are 20-30 years old or even older and were not built with this size of students in mind.

This is what people do because the tutorials are useless. Thick accents and just bad at explaining concepts. Most people go to a university to get the paper. I cant just dont go to uni and then self learn everything since HR would pass on me over someone with a degree. 

> We straight up have professors from Tsinghua, Stanford, Cambridge, UPenn, etc, with vast and extremely technical knowledge, profs who work to design major parts of internet infrastructure, etc. 

So? If I want I can visit them during office hour or during tutorials and lectures. I have that **choice**. 

>  There's the other side trying to push NTU to become a greater school in every meaning of the word.

And you do this by improving the teaching significantly. Merely forcing people to attend subpar classes and spending that additional 2 hour traveling time will not improve the learning experience at all.

> between a piece of paper and what an NTU education stands

The difference is NTU has a stronger brand than a private uni because of the research that it does and the alumni network that comes with it. Not because of the teaching. There are private unis with way better teaching but having an NTU cert is more valuable than some unrecognised private university.

No, it is not because I am against religion, it is simply because they are annoying beings. To my Christian friends, I guess many of you would also agree that lay preachers disturbing and stalking people irresponsibly all over the campus are not good for the image of you Christians (well, provided that you are from denominational churches‚Ä¶). I am not against religious CCA groups either, as long as you are not disturbing lives of your fellow schoolmates. The plain fact of the matter is that public preaching is a disturbance, and is straightaway evil when students who have little experience dealing with these irrational people become targets. I came swords with one this May, when he kept blocking the way of a confused PRC student. I stopped him, and he followed me all the way from North Spine to South Spine! But at least I managed to get him to a less populous place. Now you again may say, ‚ÄòBut hey, free religion!‚Äô Yes, but freedom in practice means not interfering the freedom of others. Moreover, most denominational churches (Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, English Anglican‚Ä¶) do not practice street preaching, and it‚Äôs only those churches who call themselves non-denominational (mostly linked to the two Awakenings) that are the most passionate, and they are really impossible to be differentiated from cults appearing to be Christian at first glance (because the latter ones are evolved from the former ones), and when you really can differentiate them, you have already gotten in there enough. 

Lastly, here is a tip: if you do come across a lay preacher, ask for their denomination, or what church they are affiliated to. That will scare off most of them without debating whether God exists.",148,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1f7z5gk/street_preaching_should_be_banned_in_ntu/,,,

,Post,1fm0frb,A rant on ACC and NACC Presidents,EverySink,2024-09-21 11:00:05+00:00,"NTUSU Executive Committee has faced widespread criticism for corruption. However, there is one group who received very few critisms despite being instrumental towards said corruption‚Äîthe presidents of academic constituent clubs (ACCs) and the presidents and vice presidents of non-academic constituent clubs (NACCs). 

For those who don‚Äôt know, ACCs consist of our school-based clubs, such as NBS, CCDS, and EEE. NACCs consists of SC, CAC, and WSC. The legislative branch of NTUSU is vested in NTUSU Council, which is made up of presidents of ACCs and NACCs and vice-presidents for NACCs. They are responsible for electing the NTUSU executive committee and determining which policies the executive committee should implement or reject.

Last year, our ACC and NACC presidents voted against publishing the Union Budget line-by-line, effectively denying us transparency regarding how our union fees are spent! This year, they voted in an establishment candidate as NTUSU president while rejecting a candidate who advocated for budget transparency, electoral reform, and checks and balances‚Äîthus further entrenching nepotism within NTUSU!

It is very clear that the ACC and NACC presidents cannot be trusted to represent the interests of their students. NTUSU Executive Committee election should be opened to all 20000+ students to vote, rather than being restricted to the votes of just 20+ members of the NTUSU Council!",139,2,https://i.redd.it/n2bhieg395qd1.jpeg,,,

What mindset are you talking about? OP hasn't said anything about their race. And if their lived experience as a black person has caused them to navigate the world in a certain way, why is it their fault? In some parts of the world, being conscious of your own blackness is a quite literally a matter of life or death.

Look up the concept of ""double consciousness""; this is by no means newfangled ""woke"" nonsense. If anything it's old hat by now.

>never use the word ""black"" again

Why not? It's just a descriptor. Racial categories might not map 1:1 from Western contexts to Singapore, but people here use ""black"" as often as they do ""African"" or ""African-(insert nationality here)"".

People said uni is one of the best times to date in ur life, people said by 30 u should aim to achieve a milestone of having 100k in savings, people in the past said u should aim to have 5Cs by a certain age, but why are there ‚Äôshoulds‚Äò and ‚Äôshould nots‚Äò in life in the first place? Why are we living to other ppl‚Äôs timelines? Why are there timelines in the first place?

I came across a saying recently, ‚ÄùTimeline should only be followed on an individual level.‚Äú, and I personally find that to be true. Colonel Sanders succeeded in his endeavors (I didn‚Äòt even phrase it as succeeding in life, because success‚Äôs all arbitrary and subjective, success could mean different things to different ppl), I‚Äòm sure u can find many ppl who‚Äôve succeeded late (in their endeavours) in life too as well. 

People rush into dating, break up later, have to ‚Äòrestart‚Äô, feel rushed again and the whole cycle repeats. People rush into marriage, and then divorce later as well. 

Life‚Äòs meant to be experienced, who are rushing us anyway? If it‚Äôs societal pressure, take some time to yourself to think more deeply and look past that. 
I‚Äòve an acquaintance who cited the same reason as u, being in the final year of studies and afraid of being alone for the rest of his/ her life, the person ended up jumping on any opp. sex that he/ she came across.

I suggest, don't 'date'. Make friends, expand your social network and make your advance after you start work. Use this duration to learn more about her and let her know more about you.¬†


You don't have to 'confess'¬†
confessions are for idiots who can't read between the lines. If she feels comfortable enough with you, she will move into the next stage with you exclusively without saying anything. Like agreeing to go with you to an overseas trip in which you pay for air tickets and hotel. Discuss with her on the choice of hotel first and show her one room with a twin bed before going for the tickets. You don't have to go far. A motorcycle road trip in Chiang mai or Bali will suffice. If you want to push further, going to Australia is another good option. If you can't ride or drive because you don't have a licence, I suggest you go take the licence first.

,Comment,1f9e2r1,Yet another lonely guy here,CloudlessEveningSky,2024-09-05 04:51:50+00:00,"Reading about your situation, my opinion is you should stop thinking about joining so many activities or finding friends. You need to fix the fundamental root causes of the problems first. 

Work on your own personal image, learn how to interact well with people, as in learn how to give other people a good / fun / interesting time when talking to them. Maybe you can watch more Netflix shows to have more common conversation topics, and also observe how actors talk. 

Learn how to have tact, like for instance when ur roomie rejects you, learn to accept it graciously as a man and figure out how you can keep making yourself better so someone will not reject you in future. Don‚Äôt keep pestering and inviting him if he already refused. 

I think if you keep working on your own image, people will come into your life eventually, all the best.",79,0,,,,lll09ab

If you have social anxiety, maybe look at the way you interact with people or present yourself, or maybe you missed some social cues? I can only say so much because everyone is different. Don't push too much, don't think too negatively. You'll be surprised at how easy it is to make friends, granted I'm not in uni yet even.

I made some of my closest friends from saying random shit, one of them was when I turned to him and said I feel like dying during sit n reach for pe. A girl I was really close with was by telling her her football shirt is shit.

If u want a club with low commitment while being able to make friends, join gem club, like before the start of each semester there‚Äôs a campus tour program where u r supposed to bring the exchange students around NTU and do some activities to earn points which at the same time u can bond with them, I went for 2 so far, one in my Y1S2 and one just this sem. 

My experience is pretty positive as I am able to click well with the exchange students and make friends with them while also increasing my confidence at meeting new people which helps a lot given I‚Äôm quite introverted.

Let‚Äôs just share my experience with gem for this sem, after the campus tour events I click pretty well with these 2 girls from Finland and Sweden(my assigned group was like 80% Europeans, only 2 is from Australia and US each), we met a couple of times since first week of school started 1 is a dinner in school and a second one is a hangout outside school during Saturday, then 
 just yesterday I had lunch with the Finnish girl for like catchup after my lab session. The ones I met this sem is the best as compared to previous 2 semesters in terms of how we click mutually ah.

Although I plan to join some trivial event in the middle of the school under gem but didn‚Äôt go due to lack of time but at the same time I also feel with the people I click well with I feel is enough atleast for this sem without stretching myself too much.

As for class perhaps just sit beside someone and ask lecture related stuff or something which is kinda what I did for my class, tho we ain‚Äôt like super close to the point like we eat consistently together but they are friendly enough to talk abit which of course pave way for future collaboration in group work and etc.",4,0,,,,lll56e3

At this point just add a new fees on top of the already existing fees which we pay coz I guess that's what matters the most to NTU. 
And when the buses do finally show up, they often come in clumps‚Äîone after another‚Äîmaking it completely pointless. You end up waiting for what seems like forever, only for three buses to roll in simultaneously, creating chaos and congestion. It‚Äôs clear that there‚Äôs no coherent planning or efficient scheduling behind it. Why is it so difficult to have a reliable, consistent bus service that actually meets the needs of the students. It‚Äôs not just inconvenient; it‚Äôs downright insulting and stupid. If NTU is serious about improving campus life, sorting out this bus mess should be a top priority.",114,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1firzvx/ntus_schrodinger_bus/,,,

Clumping is inevitable because all roads in ntu are single laned both directions, but personally i think they did increase the number of buses in the loop alr

,Comment,1firzvx,NTU's Schrodinger bus,BillRevolutionary990,2024-09-17 07:50:13+00:00,"You would actually increase clumping. Clumping is like trying to walk in a line with even spaces when the first guy keeps stopping. Because each bus is only ten minutes behind each other. Esp during peak hours embarking and disembarking can take 2-3 minutes. The first bus picks up all the load so subsequent ones are a lot faster. You could do very self defeating things like making buses stop when the one ahead stops.

And you're isolated from the cost but buses are not cheap. At surge pricing it's \~110/hr. At 2 hours in a peak hour, two peak hours a day, two buses more per route on both main routes, every weekday for half the year, is 230k a year.

It's not consistent because student schedules are extremely inconsistent. It has huge spikes of a 30k student pop for exams, classes, going home etc. It is not efficient because trying to schedule buses for this many students is almost impossible without a complex system to track, record and anticipate student movements.",15,0,,,,lnjf3cw

The period of suspension is two weeks from Sept 10 to 23.

The licensee has accumulated 12 demerit points within a 12-month period and was fined a total of $800 for selling food that contained ""matter foreign to the nature of such food"" and failing to keep its premises free of infestation.

Based on track records, a licensee who accumulates 12 or more demerit points during a 12-month period may have his licence suspended for a period of either two or four weeks or cancelled.

All food handlers working in the suspended premises would also be required to re-attend and pass the WSQ Food Safety Course Level 1, before they can resume work as food handlers.

The licensee is also required to ensure that all food hygiene officers working in the suspended premises, if any, re-attend and pass the Workforce Skills Qualifications Food Safety Course Level 3.

SFA also advises members of the public who come across poor food safety practices in food establishments not to patronise such outlets and provide feedback via the online feedback form at www.sfa.gov.sg/feedback or to call SFA Contact Centre at 6805-2871 with details for our follow-up investigations.",23,0,,,,lmkuxgn

Timeline: Singapore school term is Jan - Nov, and after your A level, you are wasting 10-month time before can get started. May other countries do AY from Sep-June, so no time wastage when it comes to admission into uni.

Rigid system: Level-skipping is highly restricted in Singapore, the odd is about 3 in 100k, meaning every cohort there is only 1 or 2. And one can't just take A-Level/IB as a private candidate if studying in the public schools.

I repeated that I wanted a dine-in meal just to make sure he heard my request, then he suddenly became supper mad and lifted his hand to show me the plate he was holding, yelling at me loudly to hurry up and order my food.

Its just most singaporean places that sell indian food actually sell the 'southern indian style takes' of most dishes, which for biryani is usually a more tangy vibrant color spice style, (which is well appreciated too). And a lot of Singaporeans take those dishes as the 'classic cultural' cook. Which is why Northern Indian dishes are a pleasant '....oh wow!' for those who have only had the more tangy biryani, or rasam, or dosa, or certain types of daal, or whatnot.

No problem! The T-84 is a Ukrainian battle tank based on the soviet T-80, specifically the iteration T-80UD. The T-84 was first introduced in 1976 and entered service in 1999.

Equipped with a 6TD-2E 6-cylinder turbocharged liquid cooled engine, the T-84 has a maximum speed of 70km/h and if fuel tanks are added, a maximum travelling distance of 500km. Additionally, such a powerful engine gives the T-84 an amazing power-to-weight ratio of 26 horsepower/tonne.

The T-84 main armament is smoothbore 125mm KBA-3 cannon capable of firing HEAT, HE-FRAG, and APFSDS rounds as well as laser guided missiles. The cannon is fed by an auto loader, conveyor and control system, therefore eliminating the need for a manual loader. Other armaments include a KT-7.62 coaxial machine gun and at KT-12.7 anti-aircraft machine gun to defend the metallic beast against infantry and air units respectively. 

Moving on to the defensive stats of the T-84, the T-84 is equipped with duplet Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA), Zaslin Active Protection System, Varta optronic countermeasures system and other tank protection systems. Particularly, the ERA serves to protect the tank from anti-tank grenades, anti-tank missiles and HEAT projectiles. 

The T-84 is currently serving the Ukrainian army in the Russian invasion of Ukraine and is believed to have been deployed by the 14th Mechandized Brigade during the battle in Donbas.",6,0,,,,lnv8kua

,Post,1fm9xnw,Reform the clubs!,BillRevolutionary990,2024-09-21 18:46:48+00:00,"tl;dr [sign this petition for reforms that fight back against NTUSU shenanigans, get rid of do-nothing clubs and create a culture where good people are encouraged to create great clubs](https://forms.gle/Ag7oB76MwxkCmjKG6) (which I will be forwarding to the SAO to demand reforms).

The NTU Students' Union (NTUSU) are plagued with a series of concerning issues, including allegations of racism, attempted drugging (vodka incident), incompetence, reports of candidate manipulation, and opaque financial and political processes. The wider club scene also has problems like limited participation and being ""do-nothing"" clubs. The root cause of these issues lies in a system that discourages good, capable individuals from taking on leadership roles and, for those who do, makes it difficult to perform effectively. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle of dysfunction. There are three fundamental, systemic reasons why the current system doesn't work:

1. **Barriers to Leadership for Good People**:
   * Talented and well-intentioned individuals face significant obstacles in entering leadership positions. Clubs with elected leaders often operate under obscure and hidden processes, including secretive deconflict lists, inaccessible whistleblowing systems, opaque nomination procedures, and indirect voting mechanisms. Special interest clubs, which do not allow for democratic voting, are governed by nepotism, where the outgoing executive committee handpicks the next. While some smaller clubs may function adequately, the majority see leadership roles filled by individuals more concerned with social climbing than contributing to the club‚Äôs success. These are often those who engage in brown nosing, political networking, and sometimes, manipulation.
2. **Running a Club is Time-Consuming and Penalizes Good Leadership**:
   * Successfully managing a club requires considerable time and energy, often at the expense of a student's academic performance, internships, and projects. The only current benefit - hall points - are typically monopolized by those described in the previous point, leaving dedicated individuals with little to show for their efforts.
3. **Lack of Accountability and Feedback Mechanisms**:
   * Student organizations, including NTUSU and academic constituent clubs, are frequently perceived as ""useless"". There are no structured feedback mechanisms, and leaders have no reliable means of understanding student needs or how many support particular initiatives. Consequently, a good leader has no systematic way to gather feedback and address issues effectively, while a poor leader can ignore even widespread concerns without repercussions.

This environment dissuades capable students from stepping into leadership positions, as they recognize that their efforts are likely to be diluted and their potential impact minimized. Even in special interest clubs, students are discouraged from starting new clubs, as the Student Affairs Office (SAO) enforces strict prohibitions on creating clubs with similar purposes, granting existing clubs (and their handpicked exco successors) a perpetual monopoly over certain areas. But how can we change it?

# Proposed Reforms:

1. **Reform Voting Procedures in Privileged Clubs**: Certain clubs are meant to directly serve the student body (compared to pursuing and interest) and have privileged access to the administration. By their nature there can only be one such club. These are clubs like NTUSU or Academic Constituent Clubs. Such clubs which enjoy extraordinary privilege and influence, they must be held directly accountable to the students they serve.
   * **Direct Elections**: The current system of indirect voting, particularly within NTUSU, must be replaced with direct voting. The current structure, in which representatives‚Äîwho collectively represent only a small fraction of the 20,000+ students‚Äîselect leaders, is ridiculous. Furthermore, an ""Against"" option should be included on ballots to give students the ability to reject unsuitable candidates and trigger new elections.
   * **Transparency**: All documentation related to leadership elections, including candidate nominations, reasons for disqualifying candidates, whistleblowing reports, and deconflict lists, must be made publicly accessible. Financial documents for clubs funded by student fees, such as NTUSU, must also be made transparent to ensure accountability.
   * **Addressing Student Issues**: Clubs that are based on serving students (such as NTUSU, Academic Constituent Clubs etc) should prioritize serving student needs. A clear, public list of student issues should be maintained, starting with those raised during elections and expanded based on popular demand. A weekly Outlook poll - replacing or included in the updates we already get from NTUSU - could be implemented to assess student satisfaction with ongoing initiatives and to gather new concerns. This simple feedback mechanism would require minimal resources to set up but would vastly improve responsiveness.
2. **Elevate the Role of Special Interest Clubs**: Special interest clubs should be valued as key platforms for imparting knowledge and fostering student achievement, not just ""side hobbies"". NTU‚Äôs current system lacks support for critical fields like AI, innovation, and student research. High performing students don't get any recognition, but do-nothing clubs are recognized by NTU. For example, the competitive programming group has won international competitions but is not recognized as a club. But the NTU Open Source Society - which has made zero contributions to open source software - receives hall points, funding, rooms, and so on.
   * **End Monopolies**: The SAO must allow the formation of multiple clubs with similar focuses, introducing a ""Tier 5"" system for new clubs. While the administration cannot provide unlimited resources (especially hall points and money), these Tier 5 clubs would have access to free, underutilized resources like empty tutorial rooms and lecture halls at low-priority booking slots. This system would encourage healthy competition, allowing new clubs to eventually overtake do-nothing ones based on merit.
   * **Achievement-Driven Rankings**: The current ranking system, based on membership size and minimal activity requirements, is inadequate. Clubs should be assessed based on their achievements, outputs, and contributions. For example, hobby clubs like the Visual Arts Society could be evaluated based on student feedback, while technical clubs like the Open Source Society could be ranked based on their success in competitions, or contributions to research and innovation. NTU must recognize the diversity of interests across its student body and evaluate clubs accordingly. Faculty sponsors with expertise in the club‚Äôs field should play a central role in guiding clubs toward meaningful achievement and should have their clubs success included in their KPIs.
3. **Provide Greater Support for Successful Club Leaders**:
   * Students who effectively run clubs or achieve significant success should be recognized and rewarded. NTU should allow leadership roles and significant student accomplishments to count as ""Special Activities"" BDEs, with grades reflecting their contributions. Managing a club or winning a major competition is no less educational than taking a BDE in photography. Additionally, NTU should proactively encourage high-achieving students to take on leadership/competitive roles. Currently, many talented students avoid club leadership due to the systemic challenges outlined above.

Tars all student bodies with the same brush.


>root cause of these issues lies in a system that discourages good, capable individuals from taking on leadership roles and, for those who do, makes it difficult to perform effectively. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle of dysfunction

There are many clubs with a high level of participation from the student body, and there are many clubs with lesser participation.


> outgoing executive committee handpicks the next.

This has to do more with choosing leaders who have the knowledge and experience of having participated and worked in the club's committees, before they take on more senior leadership roles, especially the ""top 4"". Seriously, any freshie thinking they're ready to run for the ""top 4"" is deluded.


>The only current benefit - hall points

Argument fails in light of the numerous Non-constituent clubs, whose leaders and members receive limited benefits, if any at all.


>frequently perceived as ""useless"".

>no reliable means of understanding student needs or how many support particular initiatives

Hard to believe this. Are these student leaders not in the same academic environment? From their interaction and involvement in the club's activities, are they know exposes to the same issues? Perhaps OP is misguided in thinking student leaders have real power. No. Student government is really more like an enlightened ""class monitor"" or ""class rep"". They still need to work with the faculty and administration to get ANYTHING DONE.


>must be replaced with direct voting. 

Demonstrates just how inexperienced OP is. All the ""work"" are done by subcommittee members. Why would any of the subcommittee members work for/with leaders they didn't support for in the leadership race? In fact, many sub committee members join such committees because they identify with the drive and vision of individual student leaders. A populist who the ""working members"" don't identify will be ineffective and just cause more damage.


>Successfully managing a club requires considerable time and energy, often at the expense of a student's academic performance, internships, and projects

Hello, this is student leadership, you're not actually a real CEO or President of some corporate. First, don't expect any rewards. If you run for office, it's in service of the club and it's members. Secondly, if you can barely handle your academic obligations, you have no business running for student leadership positions. You're in NTU to get a degree first, not to be president of some club people will not remember even 1 year after you've graduated.


>SAO must allow the formation of multiple clubs

There's already a mechanism for forming new student clubs. How else did you think all these clubs formed in the first place? Every Non-constituent club was started by students, from scratch, with little or no support to begin with.


>achievements, outputs, and contributions

And who will decide whether ""environmental and sustainable"" goals are less or more valued than say, ""bringing financial literacy"" to the student population ? Participation level is a good universal metric. If your club has a bigger footprint in terms of appeal and impact, it will show for itself in terms of the number of sub committee members they can attract to volunteer their time, and subsequently with the number of participants they can involve in their activities.


>Students who effectively run clubs or achieve significant success should be recognized and rewarded

Thousands of student leaders in the past have had no need for such rewards. If you asked many of them, they did it out of a sense of duty or service. Their rewards were lifelong friendships, experience from learning to work with others, and a real-world understanding of how to actually ""get things done"".

,Comment,1fm9xnw,Reform the clubs!,BillRevolutionary990,2024-09-22 02:37:59+00:00,"1) I specifically separated the list of concerns about NTUSU from the wider club scene. But both are clubs are work within the same system.  
  
2) On average, what I and other students see is low participation and activities. I can give you many specific examples - NTU does not run a CTF like SMU/SIT/NUS does (although some people are trying to fix this), the Open Source Society does zero contributions to open source, etc. While its true some clubs do better and some worse, the average is lower than many students want. This has a large part to do with systemic reasons. And while existing excos would (not unfairly) be miffed that they're expected to perform at a super high level, the monopoly given by SAO creates a bad system where the level they are performing at is the level the whole school performs at for that interest/focus, now and forever. 

3) It may or may not have to do with knowledge/performance. The situation is better in smaller clubs, but larger clubs are extremely susceptible to brown nosers. If you're making the claim that all NTU excos are chosen because they are knowledgeable/competent, we are not going to believe you. Anyone ever who has been involved with clubs has stories of brown nosers/less competent people getting higher level roles because of connections. 

4) Yes for shortness I left out how certain clubs don't receive hall points. And I don't understand what you mean by the argument fails, I am arguing for an expansion of the benefits.

5) I don't mean in the specific sense of getting resources from the school, or things that rely on admin. I mean useless compared to the purpose of each club. And this often has to do with how they were chosen. I don't think most excos are bad people, its just that they have many reasons - both from selection to when they are running - to perform.

6) To be clear, I am for direct voting in specifically clubs that are supposed to serve students and derive extraordinary privileges from these. These are clubs that are supposed to represent students, like NTUSU. I do not mean clubs like the Sailing club. I can turn your later argument to you and say these members should be motivated by purpose etc to serve on subcommittees. The question of getting students to serve is much better handled with feedback and evaluation, instead of creating this system of hidden political processes which protects insiders and lets people like the previous SU president come to power while making it very hard to get her out.

7) I completely disagree with the crab bucket/let them eat cake mentality where you say excos should be able to both handle academics and their roles. It's a false dichotomy where someone is either ""good"" and can handle it no issue, or ""bad"" and can't. The fact is no matter how good you are, by spending the time needed to be on the exco, you suffer in what you could have done with that time otherwise. And because things were done like this in the past, or ""always done this way"", it shouldn't change. Rewarding good people should be the norm, not the exception.

8) I think you should read the part after ""SAO must allow the formation of multiple clubs"" which is ""with similar focuses"". If you didn't know, SAO completely prohibits this right now. Combined with the system of handpicking successors, this creates a system where good people who are passionate can't form their own club if one already exists, they must try to climb to the exco in another club and hope its not already taken over by brown nosers. 

9) There are many possible mechanisms, the final system in place would rely on having both long term stakeholders (essentially professors in the school, possibly Deans as well) who want the student body to develop in a certain direction, and student input on which clubs they find valuable. Participation is an extremely anti-achievement metric. Achievements are almost universally made by small groups of people. In the current system if I get fifteen people to come to a movie watching in the film society, but the competitive programming club (if it existed) got five people to win an international level competition, on paper I am three times more successful than them, which is ridiculous. Participation completely ignores vast kinds of talents and skills based achievement the school needs. 

10) This is similar to the crab bucket mentality mentioned above. While past exco members might feel annoyed that they weren't treated better, this is not a reason to keep the system from improving. They will gain all those things you mentioned and more.",-3,0,,,,lob191t

Very anecdotal. ""Where's the data?"" Even if a school has 1,000 students, how many are free enough to join certain activities? It's a university so many people have other priorities. Not wanting to participate is a legitimate right and choice. So then, you would have to compare participation with similar events held by other student bodies, before you can even argue that 30 or 50 or 100 people attending is ""low"".


>larger clubs are extremely susceptible to brown nosers. If you're making the claim that all NTU excos are chosen because they are knowledgeable/competent, we are not going to believe you. 

""Sucking up"" doesn't always work, but it's definitely unavoidable. No one is going to give you time of day, if you're such a jerk, unless you can get things done. And if you can get things done, you know you can get more things done with a fake smile than with open confrontation. Also, I referred to the Top 4. Everyone else is learning. The Top 4 are learning too, but they should be leading more.


>I am arguing for an expansion of the benefits.

Many of the student-initiated clubs were started out of interest and passion. They were not there to ""farm benefits"" like points or privileges. This is not some secondary school or junior college where you get points for CCA. 


>direct voting in specifically clubs that are supposed to serve students and derive extraordinary privileges from these.

You can already do that. Run for your school's Uniom Rep or Academic School Club committee. If you're too fresh and inexperienced, join a sub committee or support the campaign of a candidate you identify with. Go and vote, and encourage others to vote. You'll learn you encounter the first challenge of democracy as experienced in the west: voter apathy. So we know that, at least, those who manage to get voted in, succeeded in mobilising enough people and maybe they can get some things done. If a candidate is truly ""rubbish"", it would be easy to challenge them. Then the only question remains, is it the SAO's fault or the Faculty's fault if better candidates don't want to step up?

Rubbish. Thousands and thousands of student leaders have been able to find a balance. Yes, it's a balance. Yes, it's a trade off. Student leadership has nothing to do with reward. If there are any privileges, they usually don't match the time and effort that was invested.


>""SAO must allow the formation of multiple clubs"" which is ""with similar focuses"".

Maybe you should understand why they disallow it. Perhaps it could be because in the past, people have tried to game the system to create new clubs for the sake of it, just so they can ""farm points and privileges"". That's just one reason.


>In the current system if I get fifteen people to come to a movie watching in the film society, but the competitive programming club (if it existed) got five people to win an international level competition, on paper I am three times more successful than them, which is ridiculous.

You just proved the absurdness of your perspective. An activity that benefits 15 students is definitely 3 times more effective than one that only benefits 5 people. This particular comparison is silly too. It takes a lot more effort to organize a film screening that has a wide enough appeal, at a time and place that would encourage attendance. The 5 people can just sign up for the competition without the need to even form a club at all.


>similar to the crab bucket mentality mentioned above.

Saying this demonstrates that you both don't understand the right application  of the metaphor and that you're still misguided with respect to student leadership.


I'm not going to participate in further responses. You have demonstrated in 10 points X 2, that you lack knowledge and experience with these matters. Your ""crusade"" is too generalised.


Pick an issue. One issue, but any other issue than this because you're clearly lacking on this one. Shuttle buses - why can't NTU have more/all standing style buses like NUS who had such buses more than 10 years ago? Canteen stalls - why must NTU keep giving operating licenses to Food Court Operators who will charge stall operators more and pass the higher costs to students, compare to NUS where they don't use food court operators ? Deal with the table hogging in libraries or improved access to facilities/amenities outside of school hours. Increased finance support for low/middle income students and foreigners for exchange programmes.

I've seen change, they often materialise over the period of 1/2/3 years, or more. They rarely start with petitions.


I'll give an example. Once upon a time, FOC organizers were allowed to have applicants submit their photos. These were then used by organizers to choose their freshies based on ethnicity and appearance. It was a long standing practice, that through the efforts of some individuals, came to an abrupt end. Those efforts didn't include a petition. They involved collecting actual evidence of which clubs engaged in such practices, how they did it, proof of bona fide applicants who should have qualified but were rejected. And then, putting it all together and having genuine student leaders directly petition the administration for a response and action. That's student leadership.

I have had to deal with the admin multiple times as part of clubs, trying to start them and some other aspects about the system. But I won't fall into the Nirvana fallacy/lazy trap of doing things only if they have a high chance of succeeding. 

The fundamentals of what I say (indirect voting in NTUSU, excos picking the next generation, the monopoly enforced by SAO, competition winning students often not coming from clubs, etc) are well known (I'd be surprised if you didn't know them). The generalisation appears because when the scope of your argument increases, it does become more general. And the purpose of this is to affect the entire club scene, instead of going after small but specific instances of things going wrong. Yes, like your FOC example I could be very small and specific. I could send an angry letter showing the GitHub for the Open Source Society hasn't made any commits in the past few years. I could send an angry letter about how the winners in one of the ICPC International Collegiate Programming Contests from NTU don't even have a club. But this would not address the common root cause which keeps and will continue to keep creating new examples of these. What I want to do is change the system so these will not happen intrinsically. 

Well, it's less lazy than doing nothing. It has been my experience in the school that if you want to make a systemic change, it starts with showing people want it. Specific, small examples of things going wrong like your FOC example doesn't, but making systemic changes doesn't work with collecting small examples. If the school isn't even willing to read the petition and respond, I doubt another hundred pages of screenshots of clubs doing nothing, or award winning students not developing their interests of a club, etc will make them.

NTU is known as ""Pulau NTU"". If you're actually deep enough in the system, you'll know NTU admin and corporate comms hates this, and discourage people from popularising it.


NTU has many more halls, and ""improved"" connectivity BECAUSE OF STUDENT LEADERS. They kept fighting and pushing for student housing to be prioritised (did you know building projects in NTU have a queue?). They pushed for shuttle buses to be operated beyond the campus itself. Yes, once upon a time, the only way into NTU was to walk or take an SBS bus. 


Student government and student leadership is a thankless job. Many things are done with little credit given to the hundreds of people involved, over years of work. It's okay, they never needed your appreciation. This is how it is, and this is how it will likely continue. Populists and glory hounds should join a Talent Show, not student government.

Legistrative power of NTUSU is vested in NTUSU Council, which consists of:
- Presidents of Academic Constituent Clubs (E.g. ADM club, CCEB club, EEE club, etc)
- Presidents and Vice-Presidents/Honorary General Secretaries of Non-Academic Constituent Clubs (Cultural Activities Club, Sports Club, Welfare Service Club)

Each Academic Constituent Club is given 1 seat taken up by their President, and each Non-Academic Constituent Club is given 2 seats taken up by their Presidents and Vice-Presidents/Honorary General Secretaries.

Executive power of NTUSU is vested in NTUSU Executive Committee (or NTUSU Exco in short). They are made up of Union Executive Committee Representatives (or Union Reps in short) from various Academic and Non-Academic Constituent Clubs.

Various positions for NTUSU Exco will be elected by NTUSU Council during their 1st Annual General Meeting.

**This process is inherently unfair.**

Different academic clubs have different number of students. For example, Accountancy and Business Club has around 3796 students while NIE Student Teachers‚Äô Club only has around 599 students. Despite this, both clubs are given 1 seat in NTUSU Council, which means both clubs have equal powers when electing NTUSU Exco. This means that one NIE student has more voting power than one NBS student. Thus, current voting process is unfair to students belonging to large clubs. 

Moreover, how can we expect one or two individuals to effectively represent voices of hundreds or even thousands of their club members?

Therefore, NTUSU Exco election should be open to all of us to vote, just like how we voted for our Contituent Clubs‚Äô Management Committee on 13th September during Union Day. 

Let‚Äôs also not forget that last year, another Union Rep also wanted to contest for President but he could only do so if Annabel's bid failed as he puts his name out slightly later than Annabel. This would not have happened if NTUSU Exco election were to be like Union Day elections.

Let our Union Reps campaign to over 20000 students in NTU as to why they are worthy of being in NTUSU Exco, instead of just campaigning to 20+ people in NTUSU Council.

For most voters, the truth is they won't know all the candidates. You'll find that most would just want to vote for their favourite candidate and would be open to voting in any order the rest. As such, it's easier for the club to encourage them to vote one candidate last.",1,0,,,,lndadyl

And that I agree that a lot of the work done by the student union happens behind the scenes, which one way or another makes a positive impact on the present and future student body. And I also believe that you, like many who joined the student union or other groups, probably want to make a good and contribute to the community. 

However, you cannot deny that there may be people who will misuse the large amount of funds allocated to them for their own benefit. There are already doubts and concerns raised on how the NTU SU operates and spends their budget. And no matter how little is the partial fee that each student pay, when massed together it is a lot. Not a lot of students come from wealthy families, they could definitely make better use of that money themselves, rather than contributing to a student organisation that has dubious behaviour. Ultimately I don‚Äôt see a problem with better transparency and accountability, but of course within reason.",2,0,,,,lnduv13

The facts remain, most Singaporeans aren't looking to do any public service. Even if they join any of those clubs I mentioned, it's to be a part of FOC or some other social activity.


You want transparency and accountability? Plan to run for office, run for it, campaign for it, then learn how the real world works, then make your tiny invisible contribution to making things better.

Also, I feel like most PRC students still use Chinese social media (Douyin, Weibo, QQ, Xiaohongshu, Wechat/Weixin, Bilibili and etc) even in Singapore, and they much less use the social media popular in Singapore or the ""English world"" (Facebook, Instagram,  WhatsApp, Reddit, YouTube, Discord, Twitch, LinkedIn and etc). 

Also one reason is that social media in Taiwan are quite similar to those in Singapore, except that Taiwan uses more of FB/Line, PTT/Dcard (Forum) and 104 (job hunting), and Singapore uses more of WhatsApp, Telegram, Reddit and LinkedIn.

Well, I am personally more open to everything and use all the above lah. I am trying to know more about the NTU community and the Singapore environment in different views.

They messed up. 
This is how simple that is.

However the way they messed up isn't unique.
This is how most of the position with a lot of resources and no obligation (whether is extrinsic or intrinsic endue) unfold to be.

I have seen too many cases of people lose control after bring granted something that they don't have before. Whether it is power to order other, money, or even simple as freedom to do something. And root cause of it is that we could not control something if we don't fully understand it. In my culture background, there is an idioms which translates to English is meant ""Get carried away"", which perfectly conclude when i try to express.

I think it is an inskipable quest for all average individuals. Not trying to justify their action by saying they are just immature, but saying it is good chance to see whether oneself in mature enough.
It is good to think about whether you might do the same action, if you are in exact condition as them. 

The Annabelle and friends, I have never met you or know you before, the only way I knew you is through all the trends describing. As an outlander, I would suggest to cool yourself down, don't worry too much of how that would impact reputation in the future. Knowing how to deal with downroad is also a good quality.

For the rest NTU fellows, if you are really unsatisfied with the current status. It is good chance to think about how you as individuals can prevent next average person doing same thing if given same position.

I thought maybe it was the WiFi connection so I tried both hall WiFi and my own data. I tried for maybe 10 minutes straight before giving up trying to turn it off. 

I've still been in my room (awake since 7:30) and you can hear when the AC turns off. At 9:09, a few minutes ago it just shut off on its own. When I went to open the app to check receipts it charged me with the full use of AC unti 9:09.

To my understanding the only time the AC should turn off on its own is at 11am just in case someone forgets about it and leaves it on right? So if it switches off at 9:09 on its own that means that they knew something was wrong w the AC?

OKOK TLDR AC app didn't work when I wanted to turn my ac off at 7:30. it turned off on its own at 9:09. It charged me use of AC until 9:09. can I do anything about this charge??",47,2,https://i.redd.it/1l44x56ksamd1.jpeg,,,

I'm three chapters behind in everything. I only show up to tutorials for attendance at this point. I‚Äôm in serious trouble and probably going to fail all my classes. I‚Äôm stuck staring at math proofs, vectors, and planes with no clue how people actually survive university. 

I came from poly and managed to exempt the intro computing module, but when it comes to math, it feels like the course just throws a new chapter at you every day and assumes you‚Äôve got it. I‚Äôve been Googling practice questions and watching videos, but the workload is so overwhelming that I forget everything the next day. It's like a daily cycle of confusion. Sometimes I wonder if I should have just gone for a non-STEM course.

Honestly, how do people survive uni? For those who‚Äôve become entrepreneurs after going through it, do you feel like doing all these math proofs was a waste of time? I‚Äôm probably going to repeat this year or get kicked out of ntu.

Anyone else feel like they‚Äôre constantly forgetting everything they learn? Why not just give us more projects instead of these crazy math tests that only future researchers seem to care about?",42,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fi7uw3/ntu_poly_cs_mid_term/,,,

People get confused with AI requiring understanding math. Well true to only a certain extent. If you are not gonna create a new type of algorithm hence no need for much math. In fact, you don't have to be good in math to have a good AI model lol. For those who actually build model, most of the time is try and error, adjusting parameters, adding more data etc.

Yes, everyone thinks they are big fish in Poly / JC.

Then you go to uni, meet the actual big fish and get humbled.

Then you go exchange, and realise that you are still pretty big fish. Just that the fish back in SG is very *very* big.

I am firm in my decision to study EEE. During A-levels, I joined an undergraduate level robot making competition which made me completely fall in love with electronics and mechanics.

I decided to study in sg because it is affordable enough compared to UK/US top universities, and its not too bad either.

However, I've seen alot of negative comment on job prospects in sg in EEE especially for international student. Im from MY btw.

So my questions are:

1. Whats the job prospect for an international student in engineering field in singapore?

2. If I have done alot of personal projects in uni and high cgpa, how high is my chance to get a good internship and a good job in the field after i graduate?

It's unfortunate that you didn't get a response in the post, but I think you can do much better with the STAR method to help beef up each point. While it's a bit difficult, try to add some numbers to it too, if it's not measurable, try to ballpark it within reason. That's only a small part though, I think you can learn a lot from scrolling through resume subreddits to see what common improvements can be made.

If you're going for software dev roles, you likely need to showcase more aptitude in coding with latest technologies. More specifically, since you're oriented towards UI/UX you can consider getting some React projects going (best if you can showcase it easily). Remember that you need to stand out from thousands of candidates, you need to know something that most don't.

Edit: Consider running through some GPTs/LLMs, it's likely they know how to improve your points

Though interviewing itself is a huge mind game, you have to play cards that benefit you. Find a good balance to show both honesty and confidence, but never too much to get easily caught.

I assume you used Photoshop or Figma? Include the tool you used.
Showing how you used the tool in workplace is much better than listing the tools that you know how to use. 

To illustrate my points. For example, I had this line in my resume

>""Developed testing with GitLab CI/CD, catching up to 6 production bugs every sprint"".

1. I didn't catch 6 every sprint, probably 1 every now and then, but could they check? Likely not
2. This shows some cause and effect, which stands out that it did something, and prevented likely disaster. ""Developed testing with GitLab CI/CD"" just doesn't hit as hard.
3. I did however, do this CI/CD testing, so I do have the reciepts, but checking for the ""6"" number is hard.

What I'm saying here is that, as long as they can't check (easily), sell yourself a little more, but not too much",4,0,,,,lpmnb7w

In short I met this girl from one of my CCAs and frankly speaking, it‚Äôs going pretty well(at least in my POV). Recently started texting and like I‚Äôve noted she does reply quite consistently(despite sometimes having a few hours gap presumably with our CAs nearby), plus we found out we‚Äôve got quite alot in common, more than what i was expecting from someone who isn‚Äôt from my major( in fact within my major I‚Äôm quite left out üíÄ and p much don‚Äôt click with that many people).

So then like after abit of thought, and yeah it‚Äôs damn early considering it‚Äôs been just a few weeks, I‚Äôd say i‚Äôve begun catching some of that oxytocin-loaded emotions for her, and like pretty much as far as I‚Äôm able to notice by now my fam def will accept her, considering my fam circumstance being a little unusual esp with the siblings part which is where some of the similarities stem from. Plus like I do notice irl she does listen quite actively, and I‚Äôd say the conversation doesn‚Äôt feel forced.  She mentioned her fav food in passing so probably for her birthday or special day next year or so I‚Äôd probably cook it(+ for other friends as well), plus I guess my animals have done their part as well to help me out with this.

I did consult my closer friends(including attached ones) abt this, mentioning I should eventually slowly reveal to her the mental stuff that‚Äôs happened for me bit by bit(cos apparently sometimes it can be a dealbreaker in a dating sense, so better to find out first than later on), but I also want to see as an outsider what are y‚Äôall stance on what I should do next?  I also want to not come off as talking to her simply cos she‚Äôs a girl, but rather cos she‚Äôs a person I genuinely want to know better for who she is(like essentially wanting her to be part of my life, and yea before the comments come I do have a good bunch of guy friends as well).",31,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fl9czm/thoughts_on_whats_next/,,,

,Post,1fecazs,Huge rant...Jeez,ContributionFresh708,2024-09-11 15:01:51+00:00,"Hi all, I'm a freshman (y1s1) in CoE. I'm also taking a second major.  Honestly, I thought it was just me struggling and that i was the problem but I've come to realize that im not entirely the problem‚Äîmy workload is bloody insane for a freshman and i do not think this path is worth my time. 

I regret choosing NTU and an engineering path. I couldve went for something more specific/niche that compliments my career goals instead of studying something generic and wasting time on useless mods. This semester, I‚Äôm juggling nine modules, including HW0001 [0AU] and it's overwhelming.

On top of that, I don't see any promising job prospects with my current degree. No, i am not in EEE. EEE is the best generic engineering degree and has great career prospects. So, respect to all those that made it through that path. Even if i was an EEE student, (im not) there are still alot of useless modules and i dont find it necessary at least for the type of job role i want to be in.

There are so many useless modules in CoE imo. I wont have enough time to work on personal projects or to build my resume if i were to aim for FCH in CoE. There is alot emphasis on theory and way less on practical skills in NTU. I know its not wrong for having such emphasis but it is just not for me and my interests/career goals do not align with all these modules. As much as how much we preach that we only learn more practical skills on the job, i believe we can keep pick up the theory too as we go on that career path.

Before i came to NTU, I was hoping to pick up relevant knowledge/Skills in Uni. I secured this offer before NS like every other guy. I know any engineering degree is versetile and all that but i have seen the real world a little too much. I do not need a degree with this level of versitility because i know what exactly i want to do 3-4 years down the road and know what exact sector i want to be in. I know how the job market is and how resumes/cover letters literally get screened/filtered out for full time jobs/internships. I wont even be able to secure a relevant internship just with the name of my degree and being a year 1 student in my mid 20s, its quite depressing and im feeling the fomo. 

I regret coming to NTU. I do not like the student life here, the culture, the work environment. Everything in NTU just feels so far away from reality and society. I also can‚Äôt stand the management. oh and im dying from the heat every day.

I guess its my fault for overlooking NTU's curriculum and setting high expections. i feel like this school focuses on their rank more than the welfare of their students.

Im just better off being in schools with a holistic and practical learning approach (it was nvr NTU lol). These ranks may mean something in overseas but they dont mean much in singapore and for me.

,Comment,1fecazs,Huge rant...Jeez,blooming_edelweiss,2024-09-11 16:48:14+00:00,"A few thoughts I had while reading your concerns:
1. If your workload is overwhelming, that‚Äôs normal. Yes, a double major probably doesn‚Äôt help, so reconsider that if you can (don‚Äôt know how undergrad works here and whether you can change it or not). However, uni should challenge you and get you out of your comfort zone. Set up a healthy learning schedule. I always used to study 6d a week and took one day off. See it as a job, get up early, take a lunch break and then work until 6-7pm and enjoy the evening without studying.
2. Won‚Äôt have time to work on projects: As far as I know you have many weeks off between semesters, use them. Not saying you shouldn‚Äôt take some time off, but if you just learn something a few days a week during semester break you should be able to do something.
3. Emphasis on theory and less on practical skills: This is a very big misunderstanding in my opinion. Uni is supposed to teach you how to think and solve problems. That‚Äôs what the theoretical mods are for. Why not learn more practical tools? The answer is easy, these tools are ‚Äúeasy‚Äù. If you learn to solve problems, you won‚Äôt struggle to pick up a new tool here and there. Also, these tools are easy to forget because most of it is just memorizing things. You‚Äôll be paid to solve problems and not how some tool works. That‚Äôs why engineering jobs are generally well paid, because it isn‚Äôt easy to pick up problem solving skills, you cannot simply watch some online course.
4. Yes, the job market is depressing. We all would prefer to get an job that pays big bucks easily. Let‚Äôs hope it improves.
5. Regret coming to NTU: I don‚Äôt know NTU that well but I have been on campus a couple of times. Maybe check out other places to study. In my alma matter, I used to study in the library of another faculty of another uni. I know this is less possible here because the libraries of other unis are closed to outsiders, but maybe check out other faculty‚Äôs libraries. Maybe you feel more comfortable there.

In general, it might just be that you aren‚Äôt used to being challenged in that way. I also had similar feelings in my first semester of undergrad. I suggest that you fight through this semester and give your best. Then, you take some time during your semester break to consider whether to continue or not.
Did you end up having fun solving the exercises in at least some of your classes? Did you find out that the world is actually way more complex than you knew before and that fascinates you? Do you want to learn more from some of the brightest minds of our time? Do you want to learn more about things that other people found so fascinating that they dedicated their entire lifes to?
If you cannot answer any of these questions affirmatively, maybe it‚Äôs better to pursue something else. But I wouldn‚Äôt give up on the chance to study at NTU before at least trying. Many people envy you for the opportunity you have.",43,0,,,,lmmnytl

To answer OP, Cert is just to prove the employer that you can commit to something until it‚Äôs finished. Also to prove you have the basic knowledge about potential work that you will be doing. Cert ONLY gives an opportunity to get into a job with minimum pay. 

Even if you are the batch top, After getting into a company it all depends on your KPI and how good you are at the job. You will start to realize most of the things you studied in the degree are not being used in industry. Or sometime what you have studied is outdated. Or they use custom tools that are specific to company. 

So then you will be working under some Tomdickharry who has better KPI (who is better at doing the job) and learning from that person. But you never know maybe that Tomdickharry might not even have a cert or draws 10x salary than you. 

After few years, If you perform better you get higher salary increments or even start to get headhunted by other companies. You will likely to get promoted too. Maybe you could pass that Tomdickharry who doesn‚Äôt have a cert. On the other hand if your KPI is bad no cert can save you.. most likely other employees will hand over ‚Äúeasy‚Äù tasks. Drops you from meetings if there is no impact coming from you. Eventually forcing you to leave the company. Because company ONLY wants people who can get their work done. No cert can save you at that point. Because CERT cannot run a business and earn revenue - only impact you do can.",4,0,,,,lmqrm89

For context, I am the president of NTU's Student Union (NTUSU) and I was fairly selected for the role after the previous president stepped down due to some personal issues. I believe that the student union will perform best if everyone inside knew each other and not waste time getting to know the other person so I hand-picked my friends and allowed their friends to join too(provided our vibes match). However, too many of our friends joined, hence the need to create new roles to support each other and assist the committee

We are also being judged for 'misusing the student funds. Every NTU student voluntarily donates to the union every academic year. The funds are used to support the students and host events for the student population. Since NTUSU is also made up of students, we have every right to use the funds to host our own bonding events and purchase supplies (Lat me tell you, alcohol is not getting cheaper with inflation).

Since we represent the students, the union helps them advertise by taking their ideas and passing them off as our own so that it looks more official, like the time we told everyone about the financial aid friends in NTU. Since we represent them anyway, there was no need to credit them for their work.

Now, everyone is getting angry for no reason because they do not agree with how I run my council due to some false online slander and lies, which we manage by reporting these untrue allegations and exposing their identities to show the world what cruel liars they are.

A cheaper alternative would be clippers barber, which costs around $20-25. There are also many cheaper gentlemen‚Äôs barbershops in residential areas (hdb blocks), but their clients are mostly locals and may not be familiar with non asian hair.

The cheapest option is 10 minute, no frills haircut places (kcuts, qbhouse) which can be found everywhere. don‚Äôt expect much but if you are just getting a simple haircut and don‚Äôt want to spend more than $12 on haircut, they could be a good option",21,0,,,,lm2q9ge

,Post,1fstagu,hawker culture in sg,Ok-Landscape-8305,2024-09-30 11:32:24+00:00,"I've never had a bad experience w food courts or hawkers until recently which was in ntu LOL I've come to realized that universities are really a miniature version of society that we have to start getting used to early

food courts r like the fundamentals of sg since it's so embedded in our culture, so it's kind of a representation of sg alr.. its not uncommon for hawkers at food courts anywhere to be raising prices and cutting portions to beat inflation, and I feel like the hawker culture in sg is all about the vibe that people experience by going there and having a meal. it's like the sincerity people used to have in making food for others and earning a living.. this might b common for most who tabaoed their food and are used to it but I'm q pissed off about the attitude some stalls have towards their customers.

as we all know drinks stalls are like the life of the entire food court, the food court isn't complete without a drink stall. and also drink stalls are the ones that make the most profit out of all the stalls in the food court (duh it's water and ice and syrup) 
so similar to any other stall in the food court, when inflation hits everyone raises their prices bc theyre making a loss to some extend.. I'm can't deny that drink stalls also make a loss (someone correct me if I'm wrong LOL) and it's definitely no normal to increase prices and reduce portions. in this case we usually see drink stall aunties putting more ice and less drinks to make up the same or lesser amount right?? like most stalls wouldnt take it for granted that their consumers are alright w the portion cut right but what I've experienced at a ntu food court was like an outright disrespect to the consumer (damn angry tbh)

I was queueing for a drink then I ordered then auntie would b preparing my drink right.. so this stall has a few aunties at the counter servicing customers and all.. so the one preparing my drink scooped a more than usual amount of ice (like 80% of the cup was already ice considering the amount of ice in the cup) then proceeded to fill the cup w the drink up to the 60% mark LOL THE DRINK WAS AT A LOWER LEVEL THAN THE ICE LOL

then the next auntie (w a little conscience) that she was supposed to pass the drink to and cap it saw it and laughed loudly, telling her that that was too much (Â§™ËøáÂàÜ‰∫Ü) and to top it up a little more to cover the ice (which was still 3 cm below the cup line btw) at least. and this was all while I stood there watching the whole process and her turning to look at me after this charade and I was in utter disbelief not bc I was so shortchanged but bc I was treated like an idiot LOL 

like I fully understand that price inflation is unavoidable, portion cuts are a bit miserly of them altho that's not what they promoted as well LOL (they put 30oz on a poster they put up for that drink if I'm not wrong)
like if they didn't make a hooha while preparing it I would have just closed one eye even if they just gave me half a cup uk.. but the fact that their attitude was like a ""we r gonna cut portions, raise prices and laugh about it in your face bc there's nothing you can do about it since the drink stall runs this canteen"" kind of vibe.. that was lowkey shameless tbh... 

then imagine when tourists and international students come for their stay and experience this sort of poor service in the iconic hawker centre that people travel to SG just to experience.. like I'm sure this is not just my experience and some of y'all boomers r gonna b like y'all strawberries just suck it up it's life 
also this definitely happens in other hawker centres or food courts and hence its embarrassing af zzzzzzzzz",34,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fstagu/hawker_culture_in_sg/,,,

One can always put a study plan and not follow them. Else, they may realise that doing a minor is not worth at it is hard to score, and u-turn to take easy modules to get a change in classification.

1. Is hall accommodation still guaranteed for second-year students? I‚Äôve seen mixed answers‚Äîsome say yes, some say no‚Äîand I can‚Äôt find any official statement from NTU on this.

2. Is there an updated version of the Campus Life Involvement Annex A, with a complete list of all CCAs, roles, and their respective points? I‚Äôve only found older versions, and I know the points get updated each year, but I can‚Äôt seem to find the most current one.

3. Is there a way to secure a single room or specific room types? For example, if you‚Äôre in JCRC, do you get priority for single rooms? I‚Äôm curious if there are any strategies that can increase my chances of getting a single room next year.

4. What does the hall application process look like for second-year students? Do we still rank our room type preferences, or do we get to choose the hall we want to stay in as well?

5. Lastly, if I have 5 CCA points but my CCA commitments are not hall-based (e.g., I‚Äôm involved in Student Union or WSC instead of hall councils or hall sports), does this mean I can still get a spot in a hall in general, but I might not get my preferred hall since I haven‚Äôt contributed much to it?

,Comment,1fbpdu7,Questions about hall allocation system,uniishell,2024-09-08 06:34:23+00:00,"1. yes
2. not sure
3. nothing is ever guaranteed when it comes to hall. u can only get the highest hall points (9) and apply for your preferred hall and unit, but really up to OCH to allocate u. usually 9 pointers shld be guaranteed la, 7 pointers a bit iffy alr, and 5 pointers on waitlist
4. u can apply room type, hall, and specific unit number
5. u can still get a hall, same probability as every other 5 pointer. Unless they‚Äôre a 5 pointer with rec list then they‚Äôll be prioritised higher than u. 

U not getting your preferred hall won‚Äôt be because u didn‚Äôt participate in hall, but because 5 points is too low to be guaranteed a hall, so you‚Äôll likely be placed on waitlist and OCH will just allocate u accordingly. i mean they will probably try to allocate u to your preferred hall, but ofc subject to whether there are still spots available 


i had 5 points in CAC for all 4 years in ntu, was a complete hall ghost and only using my room to eat and sleep and study and collect welfare packs. year 1 i was allocated single non ac at pioneer, and it was my preferred room type. year 2 i was allocated double at hall 10 with my friend. year 3 i applied for hall 10 single but was put on waitlist and eventually got allocated hall 10 double in mid september. year 4 i applied for banyan non ac single and was put on waitlist until mid aug and was eventually offered that.",8,0,,,,lm2qmtp

It pays well and I‚Äôd love to take up that role since I might do a PhD in a few years and having research experience is just great.

However, I‚Äôm wondering how it feels being an RA. I understand that every RA is different because you have different supervisors. But in general:

1. Is work from home possible? My home is too far and it‚Äôs a non-experimental position, meaning no lab work just paper work mostly.
2. How flexible are the schedule?
3. What‚Äôs usually expected being an RA?
4. Is it possible to publish some papers to get myself ready for PhD work?
5. Anything else I should know before I start?

,Comment,1fhc7sw,What‚Äôs your experience being an RA?,hotshotmule,2024-09-15 13:28:55+00:00,"Points 1 &2 highly depends on your lab/supervisor/prof. 
3 - probably assist in whatever the prof needs ; that can include writing proposals, running the prof projects. 

4. Really difficult since you‚Äôre doing it for your prof/ RF/ PhD student, so you‚Äôll most likely only be one of the author. Unless you can convince your prof that you can run your own project. Just a fun fact, typical science PhD students require 3 chapters for their thesis (so why not just do a PhD and publish 3 papers? Instead of ‚Äúpreparing‚Äù)

5. Find a good boss/prof? Try to get like a part time PhD position while being an RA if possible. However best case scenario is still being a full time PhD student WITH scholarship. Goodluck

1) Totally depends on your RO. If your Prof requires you to show face, you just gotta do it. I have managed some researchers who work purely from home unless there are meetings or presentations, to both internal and external parties.

2) Depends on your Prof. Most are not too tight on the start/end work time so long as you meet your KPI and milestones.

3) Take initiative. Come up with constructive ideas/criticism. Hit your KPIs. 

4) Definitely possible. Easier to publish as a team though. Typically in a year(for a freshie like yourself) should be able to co-author 4-5 papers minimum.

5) Get to know your team, supervisors(RFs & REs) and RO(your Prof) before starting. Helps plenty with some team understanding. Know how they work. Ask questions such as work arrangements and allocation.",1,0,,,,lnhlndu

(Probably means someone said the wrong date and nobody cares to check). Personally one day isn‚Äôt enough to complete the content but too late to think about that now. 

Format will not be a debate but rather two teams will take turns to argue their stance, the order of which team goes first should be set already. So for example, red team first, then blue team second. If you‚Äôre confused about how red team rebuts as the first presenter, you are expected to anticipate possible counters. Even if you‚Äôre blue team and go second, you do not need to rebut red team‚Äôs points on the spot. You do the same and prepare for possible counters beforehand. After both teams presented, there‚Äôll be a QnA open to the class and they get class participation for asking dumb questions that you‚Äôre forced to answer.

So what you need to do now is find 2-3 ethical theories or whatever to support your stance, then 2 more rebuttals for possible counters. I seen some groups work with the other team to form their rebuttals but it‚Äôll sound so smooth the prof will also know y‚Äôall cheated.

I've done a lot of research, and I know that I have to get as high of a gpa as possible (good fch), and taking a BDE from the course would be good as well, but I unforunately didn't manage to get one during add/drop period.

Some good study habits are to condition yourself to study in a particular environment. For example, go down to the study room and leave your phone in your room. Force yourself to only study in that room. Whenever you need a break, leave the room.

Another one is to simply remove anything that distracts you from studying, like your phone. Just leave your phone in your room or use some free app similar to forest. 

Lastly, I think it‚Äôs important to take frequent breaks when you study. You shouldn‚Äôt completely cut yourself off from entertainment. 

Don‚Äôt feel guilty because this isn‚Äôt a mindset issue (although a strong mindset helps!). If you‚Äôre feeling particularly unproductive after a long day, it‚Äôs sometimes better to just go sleep rather than force yourself to study.",10,0,,,,lok6mxm

,Post,1fpub9h,Which CS internship to accept for PI,LoveBurgerHateRice,2024-09-26 11:53:21+00:00,"After many applications and interviews, I finally received 2 offers today

A. Local cybersecurity SME < 50 employees:
- software developer, job seems pretty standard software dev intern type
- development/testing/documentation of the cybersecurity product
- probably working with full-time devs and can learn from them
- likely no WFH but slightly closer to home

B. Non-tech public sector statutory board:
- working on an existing project developed by previous interns
- project topic is hardware+software and is quite niche (IoT, IMUs, etc)
- work on project alone or with other interns, some guidance from supervisor
- 2 days WFH per week

Same pay and don‚Äôt mind the work of both. Currently no internship experience and my resume contains a few projects relating to the stat board project‚Äôs niche. Mainly from MDP and FYP. I am unsure if it is a niche that I want to pursue right now since I don‚Äôt want to limit my options this early on in career and fill my entire resume with this niche.

So I was thinking a generic software development role might help to balance out my portfolio. Also may learn more from working with full-timers (learn to work in corporate tech team etc) rather than working alone or with other interns (may be like school project).

However, 2 days WFH üò©

For internship better to have generic swe experience cos it will be better to branch out when looking for jobs (source: me who did swe vs friend who did pen testing in cyber). Also getting to work with senior dev as interns is SUPER important as you will get alot of experience while having almost zero expectations/resposibilities as intern. Whereas if you work on a standalone project alone or with other interns likely its going to be FYP 2.0, which in my experience was quite dry... But working in public sector will open you up to full time jobs there so if that's smth you're rlly interested to pursue in the future...

About the wfh, honestly while it was nice sleeping in and chilling at home I felt like working from office was a better experience cos can chitchat with colleagues, ask any paiseh questions irl, waste time with coffee breaks etc. If my current office is close to home I wouldn't mind full wfo.

Hey guys! I've been living in a dorm and recently realized that I'm way more productive when studying in my room. The only problem is... the chair sucks, and it's been giving me terrible backaches! üò©

So, I'm thinking about investing in an ergonomic chair, but I have two questions:

1. Where should I leave the dorm's provided chair if I bring my own?
2. Any recommendations for ergonomic chairs that work well with lower desks? The dorm table is kinda low.

Would love to hear your thoughts! Thanks in advance! üôè

,Comment,1f886lg,NTU Gym (Asking for advices),pahnze,2024-09-04 02:51:40+00:00,"Hello! There's a megaton of info online from Youtube to articles, but it can get overwhelming for beginners. Not to mention the amount of fakery and bro science. I'll try to simplify it, but any more experienced gymgoers can chime in. I was never coached, and had to figure things out for myself. Also, I was obese when I started, so not exactly experienced in going from skinny to muscular.

1. Going gym is like starting any hobby. Do things that you like, and that will lead to consistency and interest. As a beginner, it's not so important how many sets, reps or exercises you do. In. fact, I recommend you try out every machine and exercise just to see how each of them goes! Focus on learning how to move during exercises, avoiding injury and increasing gains.

2. Start simple with nutrition. Aim to slowly migrate to choosing higher protein, lower carb meals. This does not mean you eat chicken and rice every day. Try a variety of different meals, to get the full range of goodness your food has to offer. Unfortunately, a typical Asian diet is overloaded with carbs! As a skinny dude, you would want to eat more than usual as you start training, but I'm not well-versed3 in this aspect!

3. If you do fall in love with gymming, you can start learning about the different muscle groups. A general recommendation would be to try to hit each muscle group 2-3 times a week, with maybe around 2-3 sets. However, everyone responds differently to training, so figuring out what works best for you is part of the fun! (I do recommend for newbies to work more with compound exercises over isolation ones)

4. Don't be scared to make mistakes, everyone starts somewhere! If you're unsure of how to do a specific exercise, ask around and most people should be glad to help.  
  
All in all, enjoy training and try to be consistent! Newbie gains do go crazy. If you have specific questions for me, feel free to ask. (Sidenote: North Hill gym is often hella crowded, do account for waiting times for some popular equipment)",10,0,,,,ller1cu

Get more points than the average student applying to your room type. Generally 7 is a safe bet.

>when will my orientation points come in and be used for hall stay? is it in y2 choosing y3 hall?

For services rendered to a CCA in a particular AY, you will receive points that can only be used in the next AY.

>how do i choose my y2 hall?

In the yearly hall application? I'm not sure what this question is asking.

>i only have cca points and not hall activity points as i dont play sports,

There are no 'hall activity points'...? Only CCA points and rec list count in the yearly hall admission exercise.

>how can i proceed if i want to stay in my hall?

My prof posted some mock quiz questions on NTULearn, not sure if yours did the same. Make a good cheatsheet with all the functions you've learned and understand how all the functions and concepts work, then attempt the tutorials over and over again. The quiz will be pretty hard (average is like 60 I think) so don't be too demoralised if you don't score well. Bell curve will probably pull you up a bit.

AB1202 isn't really a muggable mod, it's mainly about knowing how to use RStudio to answer questions, so just practice using RStudio and you should be good

On a side note, it's probably hard to adjust but try to pace yourself for your mods. If you don't have time or capacity to study the materials, at least read through and attempt the tutorial questions before every class so at least you can understand the material, and by attempting the tutorial you're kinda studying anyways. Then take recess week to catchup on everything and maybe even read ahead. Hang in there!",6,0,,,,lohrdpb

,Post,1fmni7p,Advice needed: I can feel romantic love very deeply but I can‚Äôt  feel family love at all. How can I make (or force) myself to love my mum in the same way? ,kmymchm_qyt233,2024-09-22 07:14:57+00:00,"I am terribly scared that I am a bad person for not feeling family love. 

Let‚Äôs start with media. Most people see me as the super emotional girl who always cries until eyes are swollen for movies, but here‚Äôs the catch: I ONLY feel touched by ROMANCE related movies. Yes, if (and only if) it‚Äôs ROMANCE related, whether it‚Äôs a movie,or a book, or just a short story, I always cry at the sad and touching parts. 

If it‚Äôs family related movie, whether it‚Äôs the recent Thai grandma movie about losing a grandparent to death, or any movie about a daughter losing her mum to death, I strangely shed zero tears because I don‚Äôt feel sad at all.

All the ‚Äútry not to cry‚Äù challenges about parents sacrifice for their kids or about missing home, 0% evoke any response in me. 

Movies and shows aside, I cried when my best friend got married especially when they said their vows, which means I have a lot of feelings. But it‚Äôs only ROMANTIC feelings. I didn‚Äôt cry at all when my family relatives passed away. Yes, 3 have passed away so far, and they‚Äôre blood related, and you know what I thought? ‚ÄúLiving until 100 years old is already an accomplishment, very good already‚Äù. So cold and logical!

Even if it‚Äôs just a  celebrity crush, I feel this sense of warmth in the pit of my soul as I think of him. I know what feeling it is and it‚Äôs a DISTINCTIVE  feeling from what I feel towards my parents. When I see my celebrity crush, or my real life boyfriend, the excitement and smile comes NATURALLY. When I see my parents, the smile comes POLITELY because I feel morally obligated to love them as a daughter, not because I‚Äôm genuinely happy to see them. 

I swear I‚Äôm not asexual or aromantic. I have had 2 boyfriends and I feel joy and happiness around them. I don‚Äôt feel the same feeling towards my parents AT ALL. 

If you count how many tears that stream down my cheeks for romance (over movies, novels or real life), it‚Äôs easily 100. If you count how many tears I shed for my family, I swear it‚Äôs 0. 

Are you supposed to love your mum in the same way as you love your boyfriend? I‚Äôve asked around and they say we‚Äôre not supposed to feel the same way  for biological family or there will be incest and that‚Äôs wrong. 

I‚Äôm not asking ‚Äúhow to be a better daughter‚Äù because I know the logical actions. I‚Äôm asking how I can make myself love my parents at least to half the extent I love my romantic partners. ",9,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fmni7p/advice_needed_i_can_feel_romantic_love_very/,,,

I mean, I love my mom but I obviously wouldn‚Äôt want to have sex with her, so there‚Äôs your difference lol.

But seriously, I do urge you to really reflect and think about why you feel this way. 

You love your boyfriend because he loves you back no? You see the lovely little things he does for you, you feel touched and his good intentions make you feel good about him. That‚Äôs the love you feel for him. And if you like him enough, you‚Äôd want him to feel the same so you reciprocate by doing your own lovely little things for him. 

You don‚Äôt always do those things out of logic do you? You go to school even though you have no class just to pick him up after class to hang out even though logically, you could‚Äôve saved that money on transport, save that money on dinner, save that time and work on your gpa. But you still do it. Because you love him and you know he‚Äôd do the same. There is no logic, at least not everytime.

In the new syllabus, all labs focuses heavily on Solidworks which I can understand completely, since most companies don‚Äôt really use manual drawing anymore.

The final exam is still 100% based on manual drawing as well which I can also understand, because it is a useful skill

But dunno about everyone else taking the mod, are the lab sessions not really rushed?

It feels like Solidworks is barely taught during the lab, we just follow whatever the professor is saying and attempt to follow, with at most 15 minutes after the prof is done going through to do the question, which honestly is not enough ‚Äì if you‚Äôre able to multitask and follow along that when the prof speeds through then you‚Äôll definitely be able to do it but unfortunately not all of us (or maybe just me) are endowed with such a big brain ‚òπ

What makes things worse is when the prof makes a mistake halfway and spends so long troubleshooting his own mistake, that it gives us even less time to do the question...

The prof and TA also do roam around and answer questions from students but when so many people need help and there is so little time, sometimes they won‚Äôt come to you until you need to submit

Some students (mostly from engineering courses in poly?) have background in this and therefore have an advantage (good for them, I‚Äôm not salty about that) but from asking around most of the non-poly students are struggling‚Ä¶ maybe is just a skill issue though

Also sidenote, I have friends from other labs who can barely do ¬Ω of each question but getting very good or good at least‚Ä¶ shouldn‚Äôt the marking be more consistent?

I find myself spending more time preparing for this lab every single week than any other mod (or probably all other mods combined), watching YT tutorials on solidworks, doing the homework, but am still stuck with 3x satisfactory grade

I still wanted to change programme cos I‚Äôm more into the math and physics and don‚Äôt want to do the engineering thing (it seems too realistic). 

But the current situation is that I couldn‚Äôt add any core course of the preferred course cos my time table is too full. Also I have a second major in biz, which isn‚Äôt what I really want to learn and I don‚Äôt expect it to pull up my gpa.
Anyway, I don‚Äôt have core course in the wanted major, I have a second major which will probably pull down my gpa.

I wanted to know if there is any chance for me to increase the possibility of getting in math or physics major after sem 1? I know it‚Äôs hard, but this will influence my future and I really wanted to do things in physics (or math).",5,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1firpth/change_of_program/,,,

As a student myself i know how hard it is to find like minded individuals that share the same passions, hobbies and goals as i do. 

Next to that it's really hard to find the right companies or startups to work for or do an internship at.

Because of this i decided to build a platform that connects individuals with the right professional opportunities as well as personal connections. So that everyone can develop themselves.

At the moment we're already working with different universities and startups around the world that believe in the idea to help people find better and authentic connections.

,Comment,1fe79z5,PH1198,Peannuutt,2024-09-11 12:50:34+00:00,"No it's not really worth 2 AUs. It's more like a 3 or even 4 AUs mod. When I was in year 1, I spent more time on this mod writing reports and drawing graphs/diagrams than my other 4 AU modules. This is because you need to allocate time outside of lab to write the report. Especially if you are aiming for A- or A. At least the requirements for PH1198 is still reasonable as the first 2 reports are half-report iirc. Subsequent lab modules are all full reports. However, if you are interested in research in the future, it is a good starting point to learn experimental, report writing and coding skills. At the end of the day, all Physics students have to do it. So I would say just do your best and hopefully enjoy your time trying out the experiments. All the best!",5,0,,,,lmlhqbb

also, I'm thinking of taking econs coursework in UTokyo if I'm not going to be doing business coursework, but if I'm going to choose business coursework, I'm thinking of going to Europe. But I will be more inclined to studying in Japan

wanted to try exchange in Japan as I had a friend who did his internship there and it looked quite fun LOL, I did visit him at Japan as well and I had fun there.... I know being an exchange student there and being a tourist is very different but I think it's going to be a new experience that will enrich me. As for Europe, I have never been there before so I'm going to take this opportunity to travel there. 


Have you done any exchange programmes before or applied for it before? would love to hear more about it!",1,0,,,,lmpd07k
,Comment,1fed30t,Question for GEM Explorer (NBS),depetir,2024-09-12 15:19:07+00:00,"If you see the [NBS website under ""curriculum""](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-programme/bachelor-of-business#curriculum) you will see that there are some ""broadening and deepening electives"". Basically these are the courses where you can choose to take anything at all (some people take NIE sports or art mods, some take languages, etc). MPEs are major prescribed electives, basically related to your school but there will be a list of modules to choose from. I'm not familiar with nbs specialisations, but you will get a different list of choices whichever specialisation you choose. There's also core modules (basic y1 mods where everyone will take) and ICC modules (interdisciplinary courses where you do some saikang like ""healthy living"". I was the last batch before icc was introduced so I did not take this). 

Course exchange policies differ by school, but for MPEs, most schools require you to match your exchange course to an existing course in NTU, so the contact hours and course content has to be similar at least. There is no requirement for any match for BDEs. Afaik most if not all schools don't allow exchange of core or ICC mods, so most people just find the hardest mods (that may or may not be a prerequisite to other mods they want) they need to clear exchange.

Also, i think NBS requires you to a ton of internships, so you can go overseas for those too. 

But if you're taking 3-year course you pretty much have to go exchange in year 2, which means you have to do very well GPA wise in y1, because some unis are Very competitive and the gpa cut-off ends up being 4.5 or something because the selection is based on year and then gpa. 

I'm sure there are plenty of universities in japan that have business courses and not just UTokyo. A lot of universities might also have language requirements. I went to paris for exchange, it was fun (pm for more info).

If you're free you can go look at the courses, the course descriptions, search up feedback on which course and prof is bad (lmao), exactly which courses and specialisations you want to take, which courses have which prerequisites, and which semester they are offered in. You can even map it out in an excel sheet.",1,0,,,,lms0619

So I‚Äôm an M24 IB student, I got 32 points, my lowest being a 4 in HL psych and 6 in SL math AA, which isn‚Äôt high thus I‚Äôm unsure. I went to an american international school here however I‚Äôm Singaporean. 

I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd get into NTU cus my predicted grades were really low, and I‚Äôve commenced at a private uni (bachelor of PsychSci) rn. I‚Äôm looking to apply to NTU for psych too, however please recommend courses that are easy to get into LMAO 

Anyways I couldn‚Äôt find an indicative grade profile for IB students so I have no idea if my, albeit low, score has a chance. My only niche I can apply with for ABA is music (ABRSM grade 8 in piano) however I feel like it‚Äôs not related?? Can I apply with that? 

Furthermore.. by the time May (results release) comes I‚Äôll have paid a LOT of money for nearly half my current degree. The issue is that I find NTU more worth it as it‚Äôs a 4 year program with honor placement a good possibility, while my course currently has 300 students competing for the very limited 20 honors year  placements. What I didn‚Äôt realize that to even get a job or proceed into masters, a 3 year degree as I‚Äôm doing right now is barely valuable, which is why I‚Äôm looking to get into a 4 year course, be it psychology or not tbh

2. is the mod scoring?
3. is it very time consuming? i'm balancing my other mods and intern now, so if this mod is a lot of work, then i might consider not to take it.

im taking a major in SSS (have placement alr), so i was wondering if there are any arts scholarships maybe? that i can apply to.

Hi, I‚Äôm a freshman in NTU now majoring in ME. I want to change my programme to physics or math. (Previously I like physics more but now I see that undergrad physics is not that interesting I would like to grab more math stuff and study physics in grad time)

I applied to physics, ae&econ, ME, and ME is my last choice. I thought that there wouldn‚Äôt be any difficulty in getting into physics because one friend with similar big got into physics and one friend with much low scores get into EEE, but unfortunately I only got my last choice ME. I have appealed before the sem started, to switch to physics, and to math for many times but all of them were rejected. 

I still wanted to change programme cos I‚Äôm more into the math and physics and don‚Äôt want to do the engineering thing (it seems too realistic). 

But the current situation is that I couldn‚Äôt add any core course of the preferred course cos my time table is too full. Also I have a second major in biz, which isn‚Äôt what I really want to learn and I don‚Äôt expect it to pull up my gpa.
Anyway, I don‚Äôt have core course in the wanted major, I have a second major which will probably pull down my gpa.

I wanted to know if there is any chance for me to increase the possibility of getting in math or physics major after sem 1? I know it‚Äôs hard, but this will influence my future and I really wanted to do things in physics (or math).",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fcse7i/change_of_programme/,,,

,Comment,1f75yuu,sbs fyp ,Brilliant-Big-9427,2024-09-02 14:46:54+00:00,"Hey y4 senior here, bisemestral FYPs are relatively new probably introduced in the past few year intakes so I don‚Äôt think many seniors have experience in that. What I can suggest is that you work out a project with a professor and discuss the timeframe with him/her as some projects take longer while some can be completed quite quickly. From there you‚Äôll know whether to take a bisemestral or 1 sem FYP.

As for the pros and cons, bisemestral definitely gives you more flexibility in terms of time as you‚Äôll be studying and doing your FYP for 2 sems and the project won‚Äôt be so rushed, more room for error compared to a 1 sem FYP (15 weeks only). However, the downside is that you‚Äôll be studying while you‚Äôre doing your FYP so balancing between the two will be important 

Hope this helps you one way or another!",2,0,,,,ll5j1kt

But then, I found out that CCDS offers Master of Science in AI (MSAI), which seems to be more technical and actually offers courses for LLM and Generative AI. But I'm concerned that MSAI will be very technical and I graduated with poor grades (again).

In the terms and conditions for the bursary it states that to be awarded the NTU/Donor Bursary you must not hold onto any awards/bursary/scholarship that covers full/partial of your tuition.

In 1981, Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) was founded on the former campus of Nantah. NTI was established as an engineering college.

none of the late night supper services do that. some explicitly sell pork (dingos) and when I asked raydy last time, they just told me ""oh we can't confirm that""

can understand getting halal cert is expensive and all, but honestly matter of fact is these supper providers simply do not care for this demographic

Poly learning is geared towards a more industry-based form of learning and they train you for work because by the end of it you get a diploma relevant to the industry that you are going for. I suppose it‚Äôs something like an apprenticeship but with tests, examinations or coursework and presentation.

Meanwhile JC is more towards a conventional school system where you learn a certain set of subjects based on what subjects you decide on and then after two years you go for your A levels. I would suppose it‚Äôs much more similar to that to a high school.

What I can offer is this, certain subjects in Uni are more suitable for the JC path, and others for Poly. So it‚Äôs up to you to decide.",5,0,,,,lodeb0i

I highly suggest taking the poly or IB route instead of JC if you're coming directly from year 10 in PH to Singapore. It's not only a gap in education standard but also education type, the way SG teaches in JC is different from my experience in PH since everything boils down to your final A level grade (so it's just 2 years of studying for 1 test) and it feels like the system is very much built on SG's primary and secondary school education system

Poly would be more similar to the style of education in the Philippines, you work on projects that have tests in a cumulative grading system + when you graduate you have a diploma in whatever you specialised (If you're sure about the field you want to go into)

Another option is IB (international baccalaureate)

https://www.moe.gov.sg/international-students/admission

as for poly, its also on a case by case basis but because poly offers a wide range of courses, the intake is much much much larger than jc, so the chances of entering would be higher. different poly have different processes for admission, some would require u to sit for interviews/entrance test. different courses would also have different requirements, with things like pharmaceutical science being harder to get in than common business programme since the former has a smaller intake and is hence more competitive.

poly and jc are VERY different educational pathways. u can think of jc as middle school but x100 intensity. eat sleep study every single day and just keep grinding. poly is like a mini version of uni, u have different courses and take different mods every sem, and graudate in about 3 years with the final year being a fyp/internship. most people choose based on their style of learning since poly is more hands on as compared to jc. poly also focuses much more on consistency where your cgpa is used for uni admission, while u can flunk and fail your whole jc life but u just need to do well in the final major exam to make it to uni. some people work well under stress, some prefer it to be spread out. it really depends on u. poly students would graudate with a diploma at the end of 3 years, which is recognised, while jc students would graudate with an A level cert, which btw is pretty much useless if u dont make the cut to enter uni. 

however u also do need to take note that poly does restrict your uni choices a bit more than jc, such that the course u choose in poly would kinda dictate what courses u can and cannot take in uni. for example a poly business student would not be able to enter uni courses like med/dent as that would require a more relevant diploma, whereas jc students that took sciences would be able to enter pretty much anything under the sun in uni. 

there are only a few polys in sg - tp, sp ,nyp, np, rp. all poly offers similar courses but they all specialises/are known for different stuff

Already took the AS this May and just need to finish up the paper 3 & 4 for all the subjects now; did my mock tests and got A\*A\*A (improvement from A\*AA from the AS' final results). The school I'm in doesn't let me take a fourth subject (cause of course restrictions and funding) so I've told my mom that it's pretty infeasible to go to Singapore with all things considered.

What are my chances of getting in?,EstablishmentAny5956,2024-09-09 16:14:42+00:00,"I am an Indian high school student from the United Arab Emirates who studies in the CBSE (Standard Indian) school system, which follows rather different marking patterns to Singaporean or American schools. I would love to join you all for my Bachelors in Aerospace Engineering next year! Here are my stats:

* My SAT Score - 1570 (790 Math and 780 R&W)
* I've scored 95% in my 9th and 10th grades but messed up my 11th grade and ended up with 85% in that year.
* I'm currently in my 12th grade (which is my final year in school) and will most likely end up with another 95-96% at the end of this year. I've taken Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Computer Science as my subjects. I really would love to know what the ideal marks would be here.
* IELTS score: 8.5

**My extracurriculars:** It's a bit of a mixed bag here. I'm the leader of the Science-Ecology-AI club in the school and am the Deputy-secretary of a charitable student group that I helped found. I've also been on the student council in various capacities since I was 12. I have taken part in quite a few basic level science programmes and innovations fests and stuff, but nothing spectacular. I also have 4-5 inter-school quiz victories under my belt. The thing is that the extracurricular scene is not nearly as vibrant in the UAE as it is in Singapore or the US.  
I know Python to an intermediate level, but have quite literally no programming projects of the scale that a lot of people here seem to do. I could cook something up in the next few months if you guys think it would make much of an impact on my application.  
Then, to the wildcard: I am a bit of a proficient public speaker. I've been to 18 MUNS (of which I chaired 4), which I'm assuming won't help much with an engineering course of this sort. Plus, I've also been part of the school debate team and have 4-5 events' worth of experience.

As I am an Indian student, I'm sure that the admissions folk would expect me to take JEE as well. What do you guys think would be the ideal score? My strongest suit is arguably my SAT score, but do they count SAT scores only for American Applicants, or would it make an impact in mine too?

In general, it gives off a slightly bragging tone.

You can judge for yourselves, as the bus accelerates fast and attempts to run me off the road by lane changing in the junction, just to lane change back. Once the bus has to slow down, bus driver high beams while i am entering the roundabout.

Such hooligan behavior is tolerated by [shuttlebus@ntu.edu.sg](mailto:shuttlebus@ntu.edu.sg) and they are not even going to follow up with this matter by giving me a lukewarm reply.

*""****Incident Near PIE Pioneer Exit Junction****: Due to the layout of the terrain, the bus needed to shift slightly to the right to make a sharp left turn safely. It was observed that the motorcycle was driving in close proximity to the bus, and the bus driver briefly used the high beams to alert the motorcycle of the situation, not continuously as previously suggested.""*

This action endangers all road user and shuttle bus passengers. I hope this will shed some light on the current shuttle bus situation. Everyone stay safe out there.

TLDR is that there are 2 guys going around trying to get into girl's DMs. There are a 2 tiktok videos of girls talking about this harassment issue.

One of the vids has a recording of these 2 guys' attempts. I do agree that it is cringe and that there are much better ways to approach girls than that but the comments have taken it too far. Their actions are at most a nuisance with temporary consequences such as the girls fearing for their safety. The comments and videos are instead publicly shaming them, divulging their personal information, cyber bullying by making fun of their appearances and etc. Can we agree that this is taking it too far? One has temporary consequences for a few girls while the other is a stain on their reputation for the internet to see. 

I think everyone's learning in Uni, we are still young so this is the period of time where everyone is still making rookie mistakes (commentors, tiktokers and the 2 guys included). 

Please try to empathise with all the parties involved as well as in future conflicts. NTU seems to have alot of issues already and from what I can see, its really stems from a lack of empathy sometimes.

EDIT: Just to get things straight,

Harassment is bad i agree but it has gone beyond addressing the harassment issue. We are harassing the harassers to an even greater extent than they have started with. (as explained in the comments)

There are other better ways to handle this instead of blowing it up. We can file a police report, inform NTU to track these guys down or talk to security. Get someone of authority to stop these behaviours hence stop the harassment. 

The rookie mistake is how they are approaching girls. It seemed like they thought their stunt would work. Harassment is the outcome of their rookie mistake and that shouldnt be tolerated, anyone in their right mind would understand that their way of approaching girls will cause them to be uncomfortable. When I mentioned ""we were all there once"" I was talking about the part where we were all new to approaching girls once. I wasnt about us being new to harassing people once.",0,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fml6zw/we_need_to_practice_a_little_empathy/,,,

additionally, this isn‚Äôt others lacking empathy. this is the guys lacking mannerisms. if any girl/guy says no to you asking for their IG, your response should be ‚Äúsorry for disturbing‚Äù and walk away.

The issue should have been settled with the school instead of doing it publicly. 

From how they are doing it, these guys look like they dont know how to approach girls either. We were all there once, should we punish them to this extent?

I just want to point out that there are alot of other better ways to handle this instead of blowing it up. We can file a police report, inform NTU to track these guys down or talk to security. Get someone of authority to stop these behaviours hence stop the harassment. 

Instead of just stopping it, the actions taken have crossed the line. Yes condemning them online puts a stop to the harassment but it also causes other problems for them. The punishment doesnt really fit the crime at that point",-6,0,,,,lobl4zq

The rookie mistake is how they are approaching girls. It seemed like they thought their stunt would work. Harassment is the outcome of their rookie mistake and that shouldnt be tolerated, anyone in their right mind would understand that their way of approaching girls will cause them to be uncomfortable.

I don't disagree that this should be reported to the authorities, but social consequences is necessary to prevent not only them but also other people seeing it to not do the same thing. why is it such a bad thing to tell other women that hey these guys will make you uncomfortable so avoid them at all costs. it's also not  a bad thing for their linkedins to be shared so that future employers can know not to employ people who may harass the women in their workplace.

I'm not sure I get what you mean. so you say that anyone in their right mind would understand that this way of approaching girls isn't permissible ‚Äì so do you think they were not in their right mind when doing this all the way since the start of the semester? 

Did you read fully what these guys were doing towards the girls and how severely it made them feel uncomfortable and unsafe? is ""these guys didnt mean to stalk and harass you so can you stop calling them uggo on the internet? ü•∫"" really the hill you want to die on?",5,0,,,,lobnhe2
