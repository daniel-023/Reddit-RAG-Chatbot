I just want to know whether it is just me or are sg sellers are sometimes rude.

There's this caifan at a hall in front of my hall that I really like, I'm talking about going there everyday for dinner. Their food is bussing. It's also one of the most  popular caifan in ntu, given that a lot of people would always queue and form a long train.

Anyway, I asked the uncle for a vegetable (and since I don't know the word in mandarin, I showed him a picture of it from my phone, asking if it's available) but I think he got pissed and said no free no free thinking I wasn't gonna pay 

The other day I came back and the uncle was already side eyeing me while I was queuing. When it was my turn I picked my stuff and he immediately closed my dabao container. I pointed at one more stuff to add but he was so pissed he immediately said you, everytime, and I nearly cried man

I mean, it's my fav caifan but I now have to boycott cuz I dont want to be cursed at again, and I'm also sad that I can no longer have my fav food...

This goes without saying that I don't think all sg sellers are rude. There's this auntie from quad miniwok that is super nice and always smile despite me asking for special order all the time (no sugar).

The examination is a sacred process that should be taken seriously and I would rather urge people to be cleansed before their next entry before someone is nauseated, vomited, or found dropped dead on the examination paper.

Why did the current president, Annabel Lim Shunhui allow this to happen under her watch? What does she have to hide?

Do you see parliament voting if they should release the budget for the country or not? By default there shouldn't even be a vote because the money is TAXPAYER MONEY. It is OUR MONEY and they do not get to decide if it should be released or not.

Do you see listed companies voting if they should release their financial statements or not? Yes, it is the law that requires them to release the financial statements BECAUSE IT IS COMMON SENSE, SHAREHOLDER FUNDS are utilised and shareholders are ENTITLED to know how their money is being used, not because the company VOTED to release them.

at this point even if students leave much earlier to wait for bus they are still going to be late because the app shows bus timings of buses that are off service, and having 0-1 buses in loop during exam period is just crazy

The Special Services Map is also attached for those who are coming to NTU from home

(I will be discontinuing the map for the All-Day Services, as the [official NTU map](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/images/default-source/life-at-ntu/transport/shuttle-bus/ntu-internal-shuttle-bus-network_sep-2023.jpg?sfvrsn=dbabb96d_0) has become very comprehensive bar the absence of 179A, and would more than suffice for virtually all purposes outside the exam period)

Do take note of the following:

* Walking directions are shown only for venues at residential precincts
* For North and South Spines, the venues are grouped by block number (N1, S3, SS4 etc.) due to the large number of venues in these buildings
* Only buildings with exam venues inside are shown as landmarks, except Fullerton Health (because 😉)
* CWR (Brown) route is not reflected as the service does not operate on weekdays. All other routes which run on weekdays are shown; do take note of 179A operating hours

Also, a tip for those who prefer a more geographically accurate visual: the [PDF document](https://entuedu.sharepoint.com/sites/Student/dept/sasd/oas/Shared%20Documents/Forms/display.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FStudent%2Fdept%2Fsasd%2Foas%2FShared%20Documents%2FExamAndAssessment%2FExam%2FExamination%5Fvenues%5Fand%5Flocations%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FStudent%2Fdept%2Fsasd%2Foas%2FShared%20Documents%2FExamAndAssessment%2FExam) for Examination Venues & Locations on the student intranet is now helpfully hyperlinked, and clicking on the link will bring you to NTU Maps directly.

The LT was very full and everyone was siting beside each other. Also, we were told to bring our OWN foolscap paper (imagine bringing your own notes)

After the quiz, the professor started collecting our papers, and everyone started passing down theirs.

However, the professor started going through the questions, in the midst of everyone still passing their papers down the rows. The answers were even shown on the screen.

As I was sitting near the back row, I noticed that a few row of students were still WRITING. They were in fact copying the answers from the screen and changing their answers, even after time was up.

The professor continued to go through all the answers for a good 5-10 minutes.

I don't know if this is the norm in Singapore as that was one of my first test in NTU. I come from Korea and exams are very strict. We are not allowed to communicate even after the paper is done or even when collecting the papers. Our bags are placed outside the classrooms even for the most minor tests.

Is this how it should be? Should students be allowed to sit so close to one another without proper invigilation  (the LT is so big)? Should the professor go through answers right after the test? Should students be allowed to change their answers after the time is up?

This paper is worth 30% of our grade. Is this fair?

Is my exam this week going to be like this as well? Us sitting in the halls together

What should I do? I don't know if it is too late to report, this happened the week before recess week and it is now finals.

UPDATE:

The issue was reported beforehand, but the conclusion was ""No evidence because the lecture doesn't have cctv""

No other information was passed down nor was there anything done to prevent this from happening again",125,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/181yewx/test_and_quiz_ethics/,2023.0,11.0,

lately ive been feeling like im stuck with studying and sleeping/resting. studying takes literally everything out of me, to the point whr by the end of the day i just do not have it in me at all to socialise. my interests arent v conventional like football or kpop or tiktok trends or stuff like that. im more into nature and mental health, so its even harder to connect with ppl. its not that i dont want to meet new ppl, in fact quite the opposite. but i seem to keep getting stuck at dead ends of small talking. like ""oh how was ur wk"", ""whens ur next quiz"" liddat. i feel like im expected to always be this jovial, cheery, good vibes only guy who never brings his emotions into conversations bcos it would ruin the mood. otherwise ppl dont rly want u arnd. but if in order to hang out with ppl i always have to pretend thrs nth wrong besides the usual uni stress, then its incredibly draining cos i'll just have to keep masking, which makes it harder to motivate myself to socialise.

so im starting to believe i just have to grit my teeth and make it thru uni without socialising or making new friends. but its damaging my mental health alot cos i end up spending like 90% of my time by myself either studying or recovering so i can get back to studying. when i get overwhelmed i just cry in my room until the stress of deadlines takes over and im forced to study again. my self-esteem is dying bcos im the common denominator and im convinced its my fault that ppl dont want to be arnd me. that i should be able to handle my course and STILL have the energy to socialise. ironically in order to get the support i need to overcome this, i need to learn how to be ok without it so that i become acceptable enough that ppl are willing to socialise with me without getting drained from me.

all the while my parents are telling me that oh back in their day they just thought abt making money and didnt care that they had no friends when in school, just focus on studying and u'll be happy.

i might just go full studying mode with zero socialisation until i get the degree, and im just wondering if anyone else is going thru this. if so, how are u able to cope with it? thanks.",78,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/17rmemo/socialising_in_uni_seems_impossible_for_me/,2023.0,11.0,

My Y1 was fine, profs were understanding and kind, everything was basic and manageable. But ngl its still a bit of a jump from A Levels, I was told it's like A levels every semester. Everything just kinda snowballs after Y1 when the relaxed period is sorta over.

Readings are SO much — and some have little to no short poems/proses, it's all LONG, LENGTHY texts — I literally see my friends lugging physical hard copy versions (they're the size of BRICKS or bigger even).  And some texts can be AWFULLY DRY it's difficult to speed read and annotate.

And a question — how do you guys actually prepare? 

Do you use audio books and read simultaneously? Do you annotate on the go immediately or reread after and do so? Do you make quotes bank or summarised essay plans? Say, out of 10 texts, how many do you actually read through with confidence? Do you (have the time and energy to) actually use LCC for help or what kind of help did you seek?

Speaking of help, seriously some Profs are such nuisance without any empathy. They gaslight you when you're sick with mc, saying they provided the module guideline since the start — it's like I liased with the Holy beings to MAKE ME fall sick specifically during this period. They impose components like weekly journals such that on top of essays (think 3k words) you've to submit e.g. 10 journals each of 350 words AND class part that actually requires you to SPEAK UP (diff from class presentations component) aside from attendance. There's also the other blasphemous kinda profs that FORCES you to physically submit and collect back essays when you don't stay hall. Ngl, I miss those times when there's TA instead — all the great profs have left due to Ntu's questionable administrative management. 

Altogether it makes studying English in ntu quite draining tbh. Speeding through different texts thats all touch and go in each seminar , expected to memorise chunks of all syllabus texts bc God forbid its open book , diff profs diff writing styles to cater to etc etc etc. The learning experience isn't fun at all and it's just testing ones rigour. I'm jaded at this point — I'm mainly at the B range with a couple As, but I'm so jaded that I'm just done and unmotivated to pull myself together to seek that A. On top of that the modules I'm keen on are gone cus the profs have all left. It's just a cyclical Rinse repeat with different texts of different thematic concerns. 

I'm not cut out for sciences but ig I'm not cut out for humanities either. This uni experience sucks — maybe I'm not cut out for it either. Just the beginning of the impending loooong rat race.  

And it feels like I'm the only one sunk to the bottom — I see my peers all getting that bag. Those As. Sigh.",79,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/182080r/burnt_out_rant_from_a_burnt_out_humanities_kid/,2023.0,11.0,

My dog is doing very poorly currently and will probably pass on within the next week. I am extremely devastated and consumed by grief and am all over the place.

Right now, I am doing round-the-clock care for him as the main caregiver. It's very emotionally and physically exhausting. It's akin to caring for a bedridden human, and the caregiver fatigue is setting in but I'm not complaining. My dog means the world to me and he is my family.

I know that my finals will definitely be affected. Is there a platform or portal that I can write to, to appeal for leniency?

I would also appreciate it if you could share your experience if you've been through something similar and tried to appeal. Do you know if it worked? What was the process like?

Thank you in advance.

Edit: My dog passed peacefully in his sleep earlier today. I emailed my school’s student care manager last night to request for special consideration and they replied first thing in the morning. They forwarded my request to the school and unfortunately it cannot be fulfilled. They did mention that I can apply for short term leave on compassionate grounds but I am intending to sit for my papers. They also linked me up with UWO. I am thankful for everyone’s warmth and kindness. All the best for finals.",65,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/17yy5wf/advicehelp_needed_appeal_for_leniency_on_finals/,2023.0,11.0,

Decided to release the budget here because our dear president and “elected” union decided to vote AGAINST releasing this for the school to see.

And now we understand why, simply take a look at how our school fees are happily funding all their bonding events, while every other club struggle to fund their own orientation and bonding events (where the seniors/OGLs themselves have to pitch in) 

How much welfare does the student body truly get, in exchange for our collective pool of millions of money?

She insist on it and I had no choice but to leave the office defeated and go for my exam this evening. Is this justified, because I think it's bullcrap!

Granted, there seem to have been a model name at the front also, but due to wear and tear from my sibling's time at JC, it had rubbed off. Even the white plastic has browned out. But this is unreasonable. Graphic calculator are expensive, she expect me to fork out $100 just for a model name at the front when there is one at the back?

Blessed with good connectivity to food options and good room size and modern toilets. I was so determined to move to Hall W when I was in Year 2. However, Hall W's management has fallen drastically over the years (and never managed to recover even till now). Let's elaborate on this...

===========

During this IHG/IHRG season (aka last few months), I heard from my hall friends that Hall W was not participating in many games. This left me very befuddled as I always knew Hall W to be a hall which excelled in at least one sports or rec games. More probing revealed that the hall council did not manage to source umpires and/or players in time for the IHG/IHRG season which has left to either handicap or ineligibility to participate in games.

The rec secs mentioned to their rec captains that they weren't aware of the need for table umpires until one week before the actual games. This was despite attending regular meetings throughout the semester with the other rec secs, having constant discussion on the flow of the inter-hall games, and even being the convenors of one of the rec games. 

But, there were always solutions to this: 
- Ask hall council to fill the spots as table umps (since they are all in this tgt as one whole council)
- Ask subcomm to fill in the slots and help each other out (afterall they are getting points for it)

Instead, these 2 options were claimed to be not possible because it was said that ""it would be too late to ask anyone to help given such short's notice"".

===========

For context, Hall W had implemented some new positions this year that got me (and my friends) super confused at the need for it.

1. They had increased their rec secs frm one to two. This meant the workload could be shared between two people (or so you thought...)
2. They created new rec subcomm positions (apart from the captains). Honestly, I only hear their work being to enforce ""attendance-taking"" for rec games and that's about it (they don't even participate in the rec game that they are attached to btw lmao)

All these measures did not help but even exacerbated the entire situation. One of the rec secs had booked a trip during the December holidays and claimed that it was booked before he/she was even elected into the hall council. So this left us wondering that this rec sec took the position up, get hall pts and then just passes all work to the other rec sec (IHRG supposed to be their main job for the whole year btw).

But before you pity the other rec sec, the other rec sec also had his/her own commitments during IHRG and so he/she wasn't even available to ump for some days in IHRG. This was why some rec games couldn't proceed because Hall W's players boycotted as they did not want to be disadvantaged and penalized for not having enough table umps. Mind you that these rec games had enough players to be fielded as a team.

The two rec secs (and hall council) couldn't enforce the subcomm (in pt 2) to empty their time out during the holidays to help just to table umpire due to them not having given enough notice (and also they themselves not being available). In the end, I heard they couldn't even provide enough table umps for the few rec games that they were participating in. Thankfully, the players weren't penalized on it and still went on to achieve some results despite the setbacks.

===========

Let alone the rec games, apparently the hall couldn't field enough players for soccer (which was one of, if not, the hall's strongest sports two years back). So what is the hall council actually doing? AITA for being so triggered? 🤔

P.S: had to post this on NYE because saw them posting their hall council photos and was reminded of this. nevertheless, happy new years to everyone :)",61,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/18v9dgj/hall_whammy/,2023.0,12.0,

I think what most girls look for in a guy is someone who is comfortable in their own skin, of course not in an obnoxious kind of way. 
Treat her like how you would want someone else to treat your sister/ female friend you care about.

Boundaries are important too my guy. Respect that and girls will feel safe around you. Even if it means being seen as a lame person or a simp by other people. 

And there’s also much value in being forthcoming about your intentions. I’m sure women appreciate that once done well. 

Other than that take care of yourself and your family too. A lot of the so called rizz in my personal opinion isn’t oozing simply from one’s own pores but it’s greatly reflected in how they treat the people in their lives.

Also it be good to do some self searching, so you know thyself and your shortcomings so they don’t catch you off guard.
Especially your own value system so you don’t make regretful mistakes in a split second of misjudgement that you’ve to bear with the rest of your life

It’s oke to not be perfect. The right one for you will stay eventually.

I've had so many nasty interactions with people since I started uni that have legitimately left me confused. I genuinely do not understand how most people's default response is to be an absolute A\*\* hole.

Text someone new? They don't respond or at best take a couple of days/weeks to get back to you.

Person you're acquainted or friends with sees you? Doesn't greet you nor respond to your greeting.

Meet a person you get along REALLY well with online? Turns out they never learned to use their vocal chords. Oh and God forbid you ask them to do something unthinkable like get lunch with you or hang out after class nooooo. Apparently that's the equivalent of releasing mustard gas on all their blood relations.

Ask someone in your group to do work? They either half a\*\* it or do nothing.

Ask someone to keep their commitments? Oops guess they had to go to the zoo or something and now you're a man down for your project

Petty argument or mild discomfort? Ghost or block.

I used to think I just had the luck of a guy that got hit by lightning 7 times in a span of 10 minutes, but turns out a lot of my friends have run into such unsavoury characters themselves with makes me ask: WHAT IS UP WITH PEOPLE?

Has covid really f\*\*ked us up so much? Has an over dependence on texting ruined everyone's social skills? Seriously, I cannot tell you how many people I've run into who I've texted for hours and hours, but if they see me in person they can't muster up the courage to say ""hi"".

No one seems to care about their interpersonal relationships with other people. They literally just be a d\*uche and don't care about the consequence. Since when has the default response to meeting a new person been being mean to them? Not responding to their texts? Not finishing your part of the work? Not delivering on your promises?

Do people not care that other people think they are grade A d\*uchebags anymore? Or is this how things have always been and I've just been brought up differently? I swear, if my mama caught me acting like some of y'all she'd whoop my a\*\* in public.

For the life of me I can't understand how being polite to someone you just met is NOT the default response

I can't understand how people you know and who see you don't greet you or respond to your greeting

I can't understand how people take 2 weeks to get back to you when you need help or just leave you on read but then shamelessly text you when they need something

I can't understand how a person can make commitments then back off last minute with some bs excuse like ""sorry my friends asked me if I want to go join them for a bbq so I cant help you guys with the project""

Someone please help me understand this. I don't even know if this is like culture shock or something or if high iq translates to low eq, but regardless I am so done with people. I am so so so done.

tldr: in a 2year situationship, finding ways to get him to confess and take it seriously

I've been in a situationship with a guy for over 2 years now, but he hasn't officially labeled us as a couple. we do all couple things when we meet, such as tying my hair, spending NYEs picnic together, star gazing, and frequent weekend meetups. we have both graduated from NTU btw! Despite this, he introduces me as just a friend, to his friends and even his grandma.  
As someone with anxious attachment, he regularly updates me about his day, transparent about his activities and informs me where he is (so he probably isn't cheating) . plus, he doesn't get guarded about his phone or social media. he probably also isn't categorizing our friendship as purely sexual or FWB, as he has never initiated any sexual advances or nor of anything in a sexual nature.

I feel he is the one for me, and from time to time subtly hinted and discuss the idea of an official relationship. however he usually brushes it off or dodges the subject completely. This worries me as i'm unsure of his reasoning behind his actions and his hesitation, whether he is taking all the time we spent together the past years seriously.  
There are thoughts that crossed my mind, such as him feeling too safe getting too comfortable in our situationship, thus taking what we have for granted. im leaning to advice i heard from close friends, such as making him jealous intentionally so he can realise and hopefully spur himself to take action. (i understand its toxic, but i rather do all i can before considering the possibility of ending the situationship)  
Thus, what are some ways or possible least toxic strategies to get him to confess and take our 2 year situationship seriously/officially?",123,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/19bavc1/in_a_2_years_situationship_how_to_make_him/,2024.0,1.0,

Lastly, I hope you manage to cheer up and pick yourself up. A fact that might help cheer you up is that only a small percentage of people end up doing whatever they majored in college. And tbh, I think the prospects available to English majors are quite broad.

For your last 3 sems, I would recommend aggressively learning about your possible prospects and narrowing a specialty that you do not mind working in for the long term. I think some interesting jobs might be: HR (good money if u can stick to it), marketing copywriter, PR, social work, etc.

Thereafter, I think you should try to secure an internship in the summer. And if you can cope, a part time intern during sem as well. If you can't win them with your GPA, win them with real world experience. 

I personally think, your life isn't just defined by your career! if you really can't find a job you love, you can always do english tutoring to expats and earn loads of money to fund your hobbies/lifestyle. if you like kids then be a school teacher (job security is a huge plus).

ICC modules single-handedly brought down my cgpa this semester, but what can I do about it?

It seems like a lot of people have the same struggles…Why must we do ICC modules when we are already at a disadvantage with our S/U system?

Subject: Student Feedback - Suggestion to Regulate Tourist Groups on NTU Campus

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to bring attention to a matter that concerns the conducive learning environment at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). As a dedicated student, I have observed a growing issue regarding the unregulated presence of tourist groups on campus.

The influx of tourists, particularly within The Hive & South Spine premises, has begun to impede the learning experience for students. The constant disturbance caused by the presence of large groups affects our ability to concentrate and study effectively. Additionally, the tourists engaging in unauthorized photography of students without consent through the glass windows raises concerns about privacy and personal space within the university setting.

Another noteworthy issue is the bottleneck effect experienced at the South Spine canteen during peak lunchtime periods due to the large number of tourists utilising the facilities. This creates an inconvenience for students who rely on these spaces for their daily meals and breaks.

In light of these challenges, I kindly request the school authorities to take proactive measures to regulate tourist groups on campus. Specifically, I propose the implementation of restrictions on tourist access to certain areas such as the libraries, especially during peak academic periods. Additionally, the school shuttle buses, intended primarily for student transportation, should be limited to students to ensure that their daily commute is not disrupted by the influx of tourists.

By addressing these concerns, we can create a more conducive and focused learning environment for students at NTU. I believe that by carefully regulating tourist activities on campus, we can strike a balance that accommodates visitors while prioritising the educational and welfare needs of the students.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and trust that NTU will take the necessary steps to maintain an optimal learning environment for all students.

Thank you for your consideration. I hope to hear from you soon. 

Sincerely,

[Your Full Name]

Well, you might be asking why is this fella not learning his lesson? Honestly, I have tried my best to park at the appropriate lots, but there is just not enough motorcycle lots in NTU. My lessons are usually at Hive building, Carpark Q, there is about only 14 motorcycle lots. The first time I got fined, I parked at the side of the 7 lots, just right beside the lot, where no one is blocked. And  there are also a few motorbikes that are parked beside the lots, on the double yellow line.

[Hive Carpark](https://preview.redd.it/m9798sji1qfc1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd82e60c8c4ba2f32c73ea5f293eaaa3197324e2)

I called and tried to appeal, as there was really not enough lots, but I was told **""There are other carparks in NTU, and there is a campus bus shuttle service available"".** I was honestly quite frustrated, its as if I bought my motorcycle to come to school, all the way from Tampines, but I am actually not allowed to park?? But at this point, it was fair as South spine carpark B was quite near, a 5 mins walk from Hive. 

However, one day came when I went to both Hive and SS Carpark B, but there was both not enough lots. So I parked ""illegally"", again, just beside the motorcycles, but not an actual lot, but I made very sure I was not blocking anyone. And I walked to hive for my class.

I'm pretty sure most NTU students will walk past South spine carpark, and you can go take a look at the motorcycle parking. It is always full during the day

&#x200B;

[SS Carpark](https://preview.redd.it/8qnm6z4w1qfc1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6c734207e701617b827d84ac849d2c52a9315d3)

This time, my motorcycle was clamped. I called to appeal and they gave me the same reply, **""There are other carparks in NTU, and there is a campus bus shuttle service available"".** Ya but there is REALLY no CARPARKS neaRBY anyMORE. The nearest of which is RTP Carpark, but it only has 7 lots, and I am quite sure it is always occupied by the staff. Same for Gaia Carpark.

I don't stay in hall, so I commute everyday to NTU, but if I can't park in NTU then how do I go to school? Even if I park somewhere else far, how to take campus shuttle?? Everyone knows the damn situation, wait for red bus, 10 179 buses come in a row, then red bus come, cannot go in the bus

I also felt it was very unjust, as the carpark at ARC (Carpark E), all the motorcycle lots are parked on the **small** **PAVEMENT**, which is literally blocking the pedestrians? But I don't see anyone getting fined. So is carpark D (Below McDonalds), where all the Malaysian Bikes just park ""illegally"". But I've never seen any of them getting fined.

How much are these prowlers even paid, there are too hardworking, not a single day where I've not seen a car/motorcycle clamped.

And I'm told that GoParkin is private and independently managed, so we have to lan lan follow their rules, but is it fair to starve someone of a necessity and force high prices? If Singtel was the only network provider service in Singapore, and they made prices insanely high, only the rich would be able to afford internet. 

Is it fair that GoParkin don't provide enough lots, but yet can FINE vehicles that have no other place to park? 

can NTU do something about this please?

About the parking? Or even the campus bus? Can we be more useful? Pretty sure 90% of the campus is well-educated or about to be. Please do something, let SBS take over the campus loops please, there are too many 179s.

Is this representative of NTU’s clownery of student leadership? Why is the president of all people mocking better financial aid processes, AFTER stealing credit for it and pretending to care for such matters?

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I've been trying to reach out to my various friends in NTU for awhile now but it seems like everything just dies out. Even my messages asking if we could have a meal to catch-up with each other go ignored. To make matters worse, only one of my mods this sem has mutual friends in it, so for most classes I have to deal with unresponsive groupmates or friend cliques that are described in the paragraph below (for reference, I'm in yr 3 sem 2 rn). 

I understand that my friends are also all busy with assignments and midterms at the moment, so there's that, but the issue is compounded even further by the groupmates I get in the other 4 mods I'm in (that do not have any mutual friends). All of them are just so quiet, and barely say anything during group discussions. They all just keep to themselves even when I make the effort to start the conversation. At least half of them don't even bother acknowledging me when I say a simple hello when entering the class. Then there are those who just chat among themselves, EVEN DURING GROUP DISCUSSIONS, because they are mutual friends who already knew each other outside of class, and I'm just the only guy left excluded. I kid you not, I have opened a conversation multiple times with these types of people I just mentioned, and at most a total of like THREE SENTENCES will be said and that's it, they just immediately go back to discussing the topic among themselves only. Fk me honestly. 

I feel so awfully lonely right now. It's not like I don't make the effort to make friends. Those who know me well will even know me as an extremely outspoken person, especially in groupwork and presentations, but I'm just running dry. I even make the effort to dress more nicely (so I don't just blend in even more into the stereotype of guys who only wear shirts and shorts) and nothing works. I make sure I always dress neatly and groom myself nicely, because that also affects how approachable I am. I make genuine efforts to try and connect, made even more difficult by the fact that I am the quiet type (with past trauma from bullying), but no one responds in kind. 

I'm just so tired, so frustrated, in an almost indescribable way. I want to cry. I thought I would finally get the chance to have some quality interactions with my friends and make more new friends after a horrible semester-long internship last semester (I'm literally going to a government agency this coming Monday for a scheduled mediation session because the company STILL HAS NOT PAID ME PROPERLY) but clearly that has not been how things are going. I have not seen any of my friends since, like, August 2023??? 

I'm just sad right now. I wish this computer that I am typing on right now was a person I can talk to. I'm dying inside. ",247,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1b27xb1/this_semester_is_my_loneliest_ever_and_i_hate_it/,2024.0,2.0,

But I’m sick of it happening to financial aid of all things, when we all know those portfolio-chasers don’t give a crap about struggling students. 

I’ve been an avid follower of student initiatives like cdgbooboos and finaidfriends. The first time this happened was when cdgbooboos proposed a series of meticulous changes to improve the bus system, even the campus purple initiative.

However, SU “met up” with them and just sniped their idea, placing the SU logo behind the initiative. 

We have all seen how hard finaidfriends pushed for various policy changes, wrote proposals and endured countless meetings with the school for these changes.

And SU, without a single piece of care and effort, simply passed these changes off as their own in their new Instagram post, without crediting the efforts of student movements that pushed for these changes.

We need student initatives in the first place because we have a student union that does nothing but suck our school fees.

Maybe I’m just frustrated because a new wave of school fees is coming soon, and word is coming around that student union used these fees to buy customised perfume for their members. 

It’s one thing to be useless, but another thing to just blatantly steal ideas off those who put in effort to do your job.",220,15,https://i.redd.it/rctfutsac7gc1.jpeg,2024.0,2.0,

Many companies immediately reject me even without offering a chance for interview due to my citizenship. P&G rejected me within 2 hours after my application. 

I know I am not the cream of the crop in my degree, however, I do imagine more opportunities for job. Especially having signed the tuition grant stating I need to work in SG for 3 years after graduating. 

It’s just very discouraging to be in this situation. I need to fulfil the bond yet not having many job opportunities due to bad economies.

As a student of NTU, I would like to bring to your attention the current situation that many students are aggrieved by. There has been a huge influx of tourists on the school compound. 

In the hive, tourists would go to levels above B4 and come in large groups. They also take pictures of students during lessons and make us to feel like zoo animals. In South Spine food court, they take up precious seats and lengthen queues for students who have limited time to eat between classes. In libraries, they disrupt students who are there to study. 

Overall, many students are unhappy with the current state of things. The school is no longer a conducive place for us to study and grow, but instead, has become a tourist attraction that distracts everyone. 

I hope this email has found you well, and that regulations can be put in place to properly reduce the disturbances caused by these tourists on the students of NTU. 

Yours sincerely,

this video (https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeRaw/comments/11qa21i/ntu_ejc_ns_peeps_whats_the_tea/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1)  has resurfaced as a result of a post that went up on r/ntu ytd, but the MAIN point is that the 'rumours' she addressed in her video weren't even about her. as somebody from her jc batch, i can attest that a lot of these rumors were about OTHER people, and when she took to the online space to speak about this, a lot of us were genuinely shocked and confused bcos she has never been associated with any of these before. more importantly, her reaction to this video was even more alarming - she went on a doxxing spree of the CHS boys from our batch, called out anybody who said her video was extreme etc. 

R has always had this pattern of twisting and manipulating the truth to fit her agenda. in more recent times, the NTUSU alcohol saga was also blown greatly out of proportion by her - she let the NTU community believe that there was sexual misconduct in the case by lumping together phrases such as ""victims of misconduct/sexual assault"" on her social media, which led to a school wide manhunt for the dude. more importantly, she shared within our own circles (i heard from another one of our batch mates) that she let things go to such an extreme just bcos she hated the guy.

and she's done it once again - on her telegram channel, a place allegedly meant for safe discourse and discussion, she labelled one of her followers a paedophilia by selectively censoring, deleting and silencing any other narrative that didn't fit with her own. the original OP took down the post, but screenshots from her channel can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13A78UsecLpe357A9i6H7IDw436PoNNNkdzPCeJk35xE/mobilebasic

essentially i think that over the years of knowing R, she has had this repeat habit of manipulating situations and framing the other people for things they didn't do. she's not the saint she paints herself out to be on the online space and as somebody who has interacted with her before and seen people suffer from her actions, i'm quite done also. this girl was our student council vice president in jc, but didn't do much to help out with sch wide events such as orientation. she claims that NTUSU engages in nepotism, but she didn't even run through elections for her previous term (you can see the 32nd election meeting minutes), she was appointed to her old exco role by the previous president. and this year, when she failed her own elections, she went on a rampage about how undemocratic and unfair it was.. kinda ironic  

and when met with criticism, she goes around saying that it's all an orchestrated social media smear campaign. come on la, people have better things to do than fake this kind of thing. it's repeat behaviour, and im glad people are finally speaking up cos this has to stop before another person gets harmed by her selfishness and attention seeking behaviour

Just like how we're ignoring Ethan Ong (well, until he decided to play the litigation card), it would be best to just ignore her actions and move on.

More importantly, NTU's student body still hasn't made demands for a more democratic, accountable, and independent student union.

So as posted by one of the reddit users earlier, the full or the"" before erased "" version of the whiteboard writeup, a person, who was NOT from ADM decided to stir up trouble by writing completely defactual and questionable things on the board to which students decided to write a satirical response to it and named it ""Misandrist Manifesto"". When people purposefully try to cause issues , it is obvious that people will retailate in the same font. 

Don't expect people to just deal with bs silently. Somehow, the moment there is a reaction provoked, suddenly the retaliators are the villains. Now the op who posted this doesn't seem to be from Adm , which is weird because these kind of spaces are only for adm students to relax due to that fact we have tons of assignments and projects we have to finish at school and sometimes we need to take some rest and relax a lil bit from work. I cannot confirm who exactly wrote this but no art students be writing things up on whiteboards for no reason, the only reason people wrote it back was because someone else started it first. (Confirmed from students at adm)

Then because the left side was erased somehow it seemed convenient and a perfect opportunity to cause drama and  post the picture  and mock art students and call them jobless and use feminism as an insult against us. Just because we are more open minded and express our views more strongly doesn't mean we are constantly trying to stir up problems with other people. They are hardworking people, who stay up for multiple nights to finish their projects and deal with critiques and stress like every other academically challenging module. We don't have time for all this, let alone writing think pieces on whiteboard for no reason. At most people draw their favorite characters and write cute reminders.

Everyone has the right to express their opinions but to just come here and start berating art students because *checks notes* they are liberal, is not the drag you think it is.

This raises more concerns on misinformation and disinformation spread to defame people.

I have anxiety issues around people and it's been especially bad recently. So I try to avoid being in a crowd as much as possible. That includes the line at the supper truck that forms. I usually ask them to leave the food on the table so that I can get it myself 5 minutes after the truck leaves. They are always very nice to send a picture of proof that they left my food there. 

Maybe you thought that it was a forgotten order, maybe you thought your friend ordered it (that picture had exactly ONE bowl. No one else asked for their food to be left there). Is there not even a grace period of 5-10 minutes? Well, thanks for leaving one of your schoolmates hungry and paying for your selfishness.

I don't like how universities keep pushing for AI art and generative content in general. As far as it seems trendy and cool, as a creative it genuinely hurts me to see some computer generated work with no thought put behind it (and especially sourcing and stealing from other artists) be out on a big display while creatives like us struggle to get our works even recognized. They could actually get real artworks and installations from our department up there but oh well. (I also don't like that there's a generative ai art course. Absolutely terrible? What are we studying art for then? ). The more these people push for ai, the more it's likely to be used for a malicious cause.

so context - there's this guy in my wkw batch who i got grouped together with, but i was seriously getting really bad vibes from him? like i would catch him staring at other girls in class, and it was like if you made eye contact with him he would quickly look away (this happened to me a few times before).

but anyways i heard some really sus stuff about him also from people who knew him in JC and hall...  apparently he got reported to his intern place HR before for sexual harassment? my friend knew the girl who reported it and apparently he was always leering at the female interns and doing stuff like standing way too close to them and touching their waist and stuff... 

and also as like somebody who's also aiming to go into the same field (journalism), i get so put off by his lack of journalistic integrity. i've heard from his fellow interns that he would fake his sources just to write an article, or like promise his sources full anonymity then proceed to name drop them .-.

honestly im so disturbed by this and i really don't know what to do :/ i know the sem is ending soon but since we are in the same batch its inevitable that i will still see him around and stuff.. i guess i just wanted to rant cos there's really nothing much that can be done in real life :(

Is it worth it? I feel like Singapore in general doesn't really appreciate the difficulty of engineering degrees. The effort to get an A grade in engineering classes are kind of ridiculous unless you can soak up everything like a sponge. A FCH score from a humanities/social science degree looks way more impressive than a pass/third degree from engineering.

The engineering industry in Singapore isn't that great, either. Engineering careers in other first-world nations are at least well-rewarded. Here, you put in a crazy amount of effort and get like what? $3-4k? I am also aware that people like to say that with the rigor of an engineering degree, you can ""go anywhere"" or ""do any job"", but how many employers really believe this?

1341.0,Post,1bdmpph,Why are ICC mods causing more stress than my core mods? ,DiverCautious9520,2024-03-13 08:53:03+00:00,"On my last sem of ICC mods currently and while I didn’t necessarily like all the ICC mods/the people I worked with, previous mods were quite manageable and work could be done well. From all the pre/post course surveys done for ICC, there’s always a question directing toward how well you are able to work with people from other disciplines, which is one of the purpose of ICC. However, being able to work with people from other disciplines, is based on the assumption that they do work :) super blessed for this ICC mod to be given 4 group mates which don’t respond to group texts or contribute to group work. The last project proposal was completed alone with one group mate contributing only two days before submission. Emailed my prof regarding the situation and the best that can be done is to monitor them in class. 

Class activities done weekly consists of me starting the docs and writing information relevant to the activity, with some help from the same person that contributed to the group project. The work the other 3 group mates do consist of 1 person blabbing endlessly but writing nothing done, and two people doing the difficult work of adding a content page, changing the Color of the background of the canva poster or searching canva for nice images to use! Sometimes they don’t even know what’s to be done for the activity even though it’s posted on the course site and can be read on your own :) it’s like babysitting three giant babies every week for two hours which is getting exhausting. 

I’m not a super try hard student, I just want to maintain my grades as they are and ICC mods are super unpredictable on their own already. I’ve had 1-2 bad group mates before but never as a whole group. This is really too much stress from an ICC mod. Would really like to know how I’m supposed to “work as a group” to complete this course. Do I just finish all the other projects on my own? You can penalize them in peer evaluation but then you do the work of a group as one person.  Is this fair to any other unlucky student who has to do the same? I don’t think the school will change ICC to pass/fail so that it doesn’t affect your grades lol 

Edit: I’m not someone who lets problems get to them easily, but I’m ranting about this because having to work with these people on a weekly basis is very exhausting and frustrating, and I cannot describe how obnoxious they are simultaneously.  Also not my first experience with people who don’t pull their weight, I’ve been quite unlucky with group mates for the last sem or two but this is by far the most ridiculous one. Throughout and after my last class I kept feeling like I couldn’t breathe and there was a heavy weight on my chest, didn’t have this feeling before I entered class, only happened after interacting with my wonderful group.

Today I was greeted with this great news, because this is indeed a victory for all those who struggle to find menstrual hygiene products when needed the most at school. 

I've been noticing how our Sc at adm has been very keen in making student life livelier and I believe so much is being done to make things easier for us by SC and the school too! 

Here's some ways our Adm student council has helped us enrich student lives !


- **Adobe Creative Suite License**: After multiple requests and discussions with the school, all of adm finally recieved it's educational adobe license accessible to all students thanks to continued efforts from SC and students alike. This has deeply impacted us in a positive way and as the first batch who recieved this benefit , truly grateful for how it helped make our lives a bit easier by having  Adobe applications on our own devices.

- **Adm Student Lounge** : I've come to know that perhaps we are one of the only schools to offer a lounge space. The lounge is a space for students with fridge and microwave, couches and magazines/books to read to relax and chill in a separate space. Because adm students are notorious for staying at school for long periods of time due to project works, it's cool that we actually have a space to relax and unwind quietly. 

- **Semester events and bazaar** : Truly amazing how despite of how busy work gets , we still manage to have events like Halloween and Valentine's, Start of sem bazaar, welfare day, and other interesting events with amazing performances to cater to a vibrant campus life at adm. Not only does it provide an opportunity to give entrepreneurial students to sell their works but also engages us with activities that can help us take a break from work and assignments.

Thank you Sc! For working endlessly to make events be successful! If you guys are interested, pop by our Halloween event next sem, where there would be music and other cool things to see!


I'm not in the maincomm for SC but I just thought other departments could see and appreciate and perhaps be inspired by the work done by them. Let this be a reminder that students can impact and make lives easier, if the right people are in power! So don't hesitate to raise concerns!

275.0,Post,1c1jouy,"NTU Climbs On QS Subject Rankings, Down On Overall",ResolutionFrosty5128,2024-04-11 16:39:24+00:00,"What are your thoughts? Some highlights:

1. NTU had 10 subjects ranked in the top 10, up from 5 in 2023. NTU had 34 subjects in the top 50 and 45 subjects ranked overall.
2. The ten subjects in the top ten are Chemical engineering, Chemistry, Civil and structural engineering, Communication and media studies, Computer science and information systems, Data science and artificial intelligence, Education, Electrical and electronic engineering, Library and information management, Materials science.
3. In overall ranking NTU slipped from 12th in 2022, to 19th in 2023, to 26th in 2024.
4. The components of the overall ranking that were strongest were International Faculty (100), Academic Reputation (99.4) and Citations Per Faculty (94.4).
5. The weakest rankings were in Employment Outcomes (68.4), Employer Reputation (67.1) and International Research Network (66.1).
6. NTU continues to be the top young university (defined as a university established less than 50 years ago) in the world.

Common discussion points:

1. Research vs Teaching (or student vs faculty): How to better do it? Research is the foundation of the university, you don't want to be studying at a uni which sucks at research. But a university also has to teach. NTU implemented student surveys which make up a big part of prof performance. Should NTU fire a great researcher if he's a disinterested teacher, or hire dedicated teachers who don't do much research?
2. Bad Employment Outcomes: Do you feel NTU doesn't prepare you for interviews and real world job prospects?
3. Coursework: The ICC mods are generally unpopular, students are either OK with them or don't like them. How would you change your curriculum?
4. Young University Syndrome: NTU at 33 years old is, relatively speaking, extremely young. Our age means our alumni network is much smaller, our endowment fund much smaller and less people know about us. Is our youth a handicap, or should we not be resting on our laurels and be even more aggressive in improving?
5. Rankings Are Bad: Rankings are artificial KPIs that should not be what a university is about.

My own 2 cents is that its all about incentive systems and maximising individual choice, instead of top down decision making:

1. Knowledge First: NTU needs to incentivize discovering new and interesting knowledge to the point it should be the sole mission of a university. BUT history has shown that teaching is part of research. 95% of Nobel/Fields/Turing prizes are given to people at orgs that both research and teach (unis), instead of just research. Young students/PhDs ask important, often overlooked questions, and make discoveries of their own in the future. Give resources and positions to intelligent, curious people and let them take it from there.
2. Be Smarter With Teaching: But that being said NTU needs to optimize. We have no undergrad TAs and a handful of grad TAs. This puts massive burden on the professors. You should have TAs answering basic questions about definitions and clearing up basic misunderstandings + software spaced repetition homework for fundamentals. Professor interaction is key to learning and passing down knowledge, but should be used to have higher level discussions which are stimulating to both student and teacher. Profs have more time to research, students get more engagement, undergrad makes money as TAs, everyone is happy.
3. Long term student surveys: Students should really be surveyed some time ***after*** how good a class is. The single metric by which classes should be judged is how impactful what they learnt (or didn't learn) is, whether in research or industry. Instant post-sem surveys can only find basic problems like unresponsive professors.
4. 10%-20% industry guided curriculum: We need more than just old textbook theory. We need top talent from industry not just suggesting, but designing and dictating what we should learn. Not some nonsense about multi disciplinary studies like a whole mod on healthy living. Many vital skills are taught non academic and taught by profs with almost zero exp in it - web dev for example, or backend computer systems. NTU should hire top people in the specific fields either as full time or consultants to build a curriculum.
5. Building and Doing: There's fundamentals you need to learn, but after Y2 onwards students should be building and doing interesting things, either with industry, clubs, profs, startups or open source projects. Whether its intl competitions or personal projects, NTU needs to allocate far more resources, mentorship and attention to these to build both culture and generational knowledge passing. Its crazy that our competitive programming club isn't even formally recognised, its a prof and a handful of students doing their own things while NUS has a whole module on competitive programming. We should minimally have formal clubs for all fields of the international STEM competitions. Employers are waking up to how GPA is a useless metric. Companies want to see and talk about actual projects or achievements, not what grade you got. If you leave uni and try to look for a job with only a piece of paper, you're dead.
6. Young University Syndrome: I've even seen people from NUS saying it is young at 118 years old (by comparing to unis like Oxford). It affects where we are but not the rate of change. Frankly our improvement halted or even worsened under Subresh's tenure. But it's also an opportunity to build a dynamic, aggressive and forward looking org. If NTU descends into bureaucratic, slow thinking, we will just be the same 100 years from now. That said when you grad I want to plug donating to NTU. Not only do you get generous tax benefits (subtract 2.5x donation value from taxable income), but the government will add another 1.5 dollars for every 1 dollar you donate. Larger endowment fund = more returns from investment = more invested in future students and researchers.",145,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1c1jouy/ntu_climbs_on_qs_subject_rankings_down_on_overall/,2024.0,4.0,

He often talks loudly on the phone and is ON SPEAKER PHONE. Plays games and naturally shouts whole playing.  
I have been tolerating much of the disturbance for most of the past semester. But during exams it's irritating af because I cannot afford to be operating at 60% capacity rn.  
I feel like he should be able to do whatever he wants in the room cause it's his too. But because of him I'm not able to do what I want in the room.  
Forgive me if I'm being irrational. I grew up sharing a room with my brother, and if one of us was studying/sleeping the other had to either shut up or leave the room. Ig uni room sharing requires a lot more adjusting.

Will your roommate listen? Given that he is the type to do these things in the first place (cb behaviour), probably not. You can still try, but if I were you, I'd ask in writing (Telegram) first, bringing up his actions. That way, if he refuses to change his behaviour, you might be able to get hall office to blacklist him from double rooms. Doesn't help you but helps his future hallmates.

but in any case, the main point is this: by saying “i’ll drop all police investigations”, it suggests that a police report has been made. when a police report has been made, even if the victim does request for cessation of police investigation or dropping of charges, it’s not up to the victim to decide. when a criminal wrong is alleged, it is a wrong committed not only against the victim, but also against the state. the police may choose to investigate if they suspect a crime has been committed, and thereafter make recommendations to AGC. AGC will then review the case, and choose to press charges or drop the case - they have discretion over the matter (Art 35(8) of Constitution). victim more or less has no say in the proceedings after the report has been made. 

if anything, this appears to be a scare tactic. but then again, i’m just a ppga dropout scrolling reddit at 0300hrs and seeing the familiar 4 letters of my course again just got me fully awake, and should not be taken seriously. i will not flatter myself (i think ppga students will get the reference).",119,0,,2024.0,4.0,

(comparing info from google docs guy, deleted threads, and mods)",depetir,2024-04-01 10:18:59+00:00,"**TLDR** : Two things can be right at once. I was inclined to believe the google docs guy was in the right, in which case ruot should apologise, but his avoidance at specific points is not inspiring any confidence. NTUSU people riding on this to push their unrelated agenda of winning over public opinion of ethan, even before the court hearing results are out, using numerous fake accounts, are definitely in the wrong. Even when or if the google docs guy is right, this behaviour (death threats, doxxing) does not do either him nor ruot justice. This behaviour is very unbecoming of SU leaders especially when they are supposed to be holding an important position and should be held to a higher standard.

NTUSU exco seems to be so free these days. Can you tell us what's actually going on now instead of hiding behind day-old accounts claiming to be a [comm member](https://www.reddit.com/u/BookkeeperOk5641/s/gSpsGclbkC) and [WSC member claiming to have some emails of her](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1brbnck/comment/kxcznnj/?share_id=rx-yXTS17XIwzUuYhtqxK&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) and [someone who's so eager to absolve the ong lai of responsiblity](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bpym58/comment/kx2qpzp/?share_id=3arFd4MZGuOKsllj_Tcci&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) and an [SSS student](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/Wd3SqK2jLO) and even one [claiming that she deserved it because of what she wear and it is normal to get your friends drunk without their consent](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/NTU/comments/1bps2bd/removed_by_reddit/)?

**All of these comments are from accounts that are newly created!**

Can we actually wait until the court results come out instead of making so many new accounts to, presumably, manipulate public opinion? Big difference between using already-existing anonymous accounts and making a lot more to make your own opinion look like the majority.

And why need to post the same thing from [so](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/2bq7KVmXVZ) [many](https://www.reddit.com/user/Heavy-Address-2135/) [different](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bpym58/ruots_online_behaviour/) accounts? **Pretty obvious that same guy owns multiple accounts here.**

As for the guy who wrote the google doc, he messaged me after I made [the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bpwpjr/how_is_this_a_real_channel/) pointing out that there were fake accounts and asked for clearer screenshots. He messaged me all the screenshots saying ""come I have nothing to hide"" and then, while I was reading through them, deleted them all and said ""why so quiet? Come ask away"" and then sent the screenshots again. Fine, I continued reading.

At this point I was thinking maybe he was right. Asked him got any screenshots of the group chat before that conversation so I know it isn't another fake channel. He sends none.

I then asked him if he had screenshots of ruot posting his name, because she posted his name front and center right? He had none. Apparently she didn't even post his name there.

Then he said after that her friends came to message him through finding his username on the channel. I asked him for screenshots of what they said to him? Did they say a lot of nasty stuff? Then he didn't send any.

Because he mentioned that NTUSU messaged him, I asked what it that conversation is about, and he just up and deleted every single message. You know screenshots exist right? You said you had nothing to hide right? Dude just said said never mind ""I don't need you to believe me"". Look, **I wanted to believe him but this behaviour of...avoiding/not being able to send anything beyond what is posted is not helping his case.**

For those potentially saying these screenshots are out of context, the conversation is relatively long and you are free to DM me for the full conversation with the names censored.

**Honorable mentions:**

[Guy who called her a slut and then said she too ugly to be slutshamed and then said she victimises herself for posting the video of exactly what they said](https://www.reddit.com/user/InformalPsychology11/)

Person who [was among those who promoted the AI girl which is an SU initiative](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/lY8ZTEgRjb] is also one of the people who's been making repeated posts of ruot, despite seeming like they hated SU for a few posts. 

[Person here seems like they asked her to k*ll herself and refused to delete it until she apologise to NTUSU](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bps2bd/comment/kwxteaf/) which I feel is very unbecoming of NTUSU leaders. They're not even trying to hide who they are now? Also, mods have confirmed that [there were a lot more death threats towards her than Ethan that they had to delete](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bsufds/comment/kxi8fwz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). I don't even remember seeing random anons do it, but **SU leaders especially should not be doing this!**

One other bit of information, but the google docs guy is interning at the same place as ethan is. Tinfoil hat moment or not, I will let yall decide...

Lastly, let me remind you all again of SU's [history](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/Jd5UyCxPWV) of [astroturfing](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/ONnyqoIrcP) and [outright lying about their own achievements](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/mUzxlz12oh) and [using a fake throwaway account to make up excuses of ""not having a platform therefore NTUSU must stay silent""](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/2ZRvp07GeQ) since 2021 or maybe even earlier. NTUSU does not exactly have a clean track record. 

Again, I must re-emphasise that I do not know any of them in real life. I will not support the behaviour from ruot if it were real, but the main problem is with the NTUSU people who have absolutely no link to this incident. They are going too far and are just using this incident to give eaten more credit, all while doxxing and sending death threats using multiple burner accounts.",76,32,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bszzlm,2024.0,4.0,

pls la if they already increased hall fees by such a large %, now they downgrade the basic stuff, even mrt/hawker centre/park connector toilet paper better

as someone who shits alot (or is full of shit) this is unacceptable.

if you say bidet >> toilet paper not wrong, but i dont like having wet underwear every time i shit, anyway most of the toilets dont even have bidet lol

side note all 4 toilet bowls in my toilet the seat is loose, can literally be brought out of the toilet - reported to onestop/hall office, they just closed it as ""fixed"" with no comments whatsoever

probably should have pursued it further but i cba at this point

I previously posted a thread about how I got stuck with a group of people who don't do anything for group work and had to complete all the assignments on my own. We're nearing the end of the semester and I had to communicate with my professor because one of them took the work that I spent three days on and did an alternate version with my content. On one hand, I'm pissed that a good portion of my work was just scrapped like this, but on the other I also acknowledge there are some merits to what the other person has done. The issue is that this second version does not align with certain requirements of the assignment.

I got stuck on how to proceed from here because I can't force my choice on the group so I decided to consult my professor. Throughout the call, something my professor kept repeating was ""the mechanism"" and I didn't process what it meant. Took me a minute but I realized what he was saying is that **based on the peer evaluation system**, whether or not **I did most of the assignments on my own**, **everyone will be accredited** for it. On the other hand, **if my group harbors any grievances against me and decides to mark me down, I will not be fully accredited for the work that I did, while they still are.** *EDIT: this ""mark down"" scenario is hypothetical before someone else comes and says that I need to look in the mirror, I'm mainly annoyed that people are getting credit without doing work, I'm righteously pissed after doing the work of a group on my own*

The only reassuring thing my professor could do was tell me that he will do his best to protect me in this scenario. I understand that this isn't his fault in any way because it is how the system is and it's not something he has a say over. At the same time, this is the most f'ed up thing that I've had to deal with in all my schooling years. We're all paying for our education, and somehow I've paid for a semester where an ICC mod has taken up more headspace and mental capacity than my core. Money well spent.

tl;dr peer evaluation exists to provide a false illusion of fairness, you can be the only one doing the work and not be credited, so **play nice with your group mates because the work doesn't matter that much anyway**",63,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1c58cui/peer_evaluation_mechanism/,2024.0,4.0,

But I can’t care anymore. Idk if its burnout but I just feel like what they’re doing to us is abnormal. 

The kicker is, we do on average 6 modules per semester when every other country’s uni’s do 3. WHAT? They do 3 which gives them enough time to actually be a well-rounded person and do things like networking which is actually valuable in the real world. 

Sorry but I have a friend that did the 1.5 year ‘corner-cutting degree’ at sim and he has an amazing job and is earring near 10k now because he’s got 3 years of experience ahead of me. 

There is for real no need for us to know that much, especially humanities degrees. I got my first c this Semester because I just can’t try anymore. I’m just too tired and instead of feeling depressed I feel free.

 Like actually yeah all that matters is I graduate - passing the degree is literally enough to kickstart your career. The rest is all you. Well that’s my opinion anyways. I’m just over judging myself in a system that’s designed to push to me past normal human limits and forces me to sacrifice everything else that gives my life meaning.

1. Prof Ho aims to make NTU the best technological university in Asia and recruit a future Nobel prize winner. His dream is for a truly game changing discovery to be made at NTU. He believes young people's energy, attitude and ambition is key to this, instead of seniority or experience.
2. NTU has raised the number of assistant professor hires (the least senior grade of professor) from 7 to 20 a year. 80% of new hires are early career researchers.
3. In global fight for talent, he uses his experience in behavioral economics to get edge in recruitment against wealthy schools like MIT. Beyond accommodations and salaries, includes hiring recruitment consultants to find jobs for professor's spouses, paying for flight tickets for family travel and having cutting edge lab equipment.
4. NTU likes to hire new profs based on research partners' recommendations.
5. He believes NTU's youth (at 33 years) is a key advantage and gives it a startup mentality. Compared to Berkeley (where he worked for 12 years) which has old established ""kingdoms"", NTU adapts and moves faster.
6. He was born in a taxi.

Some historical background:

1. Similar to Prof Andersson (the one before Suresh), he is putting youth/new technologies at the focus.
2. Cross referencing with an interview he gave to Korean newspaper [The Chosun Daily](https://www.chosun.com/english/people-en/2024/02/07/MNQGQ3B2UBE3TAXH7UZSZGKBKA/) where he also mentioned MIT's wealth, he's acutely aware one of NTU's big weaknesses is financial firepower. He aims to reduce reliance on external/gov funding from 85% to 60%, while increasing donations from $20 million to $100 million, with additional $250 million in matching grants.
3. Also from the Korean interview he is focused on recruiting top talent, including postdocs. Value driven researchers are the priority.",144,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1cy2i97/ntu_president_plans_to_recruit_future_nobelists/,2024.0,5.0,

P.s. The ushers are told to reject the graduates if they are not in proper attire. They are also legit told to ask graduates to buy a new pair of formal shoes. (Even the staff, some were lucky and were not caught)

Also if I am not wrong, for muslims(i think), if you are not allowed to shake hands due to religion purposes, you are allowed to raise up to the usher while lining up to get your degree. They have a seperate procedure to prevent the person handing out your degree from shaking your hand.

I went and the biggest takeaway was overhearing 2 profs discussing NUS and side eye fr 👀 kinda funny ngl. Prof 1 is relatively quite young while Prof 2 was really experienced (old), lowkey looked like Bumi from Avatar.

Prof 1: ""eh NUS got do tea party also? told a freshie to go for a NUS tea party to get an informed opinion before she chooses""

Prof 2: ""NUS need tea party??""

Prof 1: ""What do you mean, won't every uni organise such things to get more students to choose them and answer queries from prospective students?""

Prof 2: *scoffs* ""pls lah this is NUS we are talking about, their name and prestige is enough to convince anyone, don't need hold unnecessary events"".

We will continue to monitor the premises to ensure compliance to food safety and will not hesitate to take enforcement action should any lapses be detected.”
  
I guess either there are really no flies after a short 2 days or I hallucinated some flies when I went there wtf LOL

Driving to woodlands checkpoint also take bus selfie and these are multiple photos not just one. When everyone is super shag aft physical games also have to stop and take a selfie. Even worst we walking to North Spine also take selfie. 

I’m honestly quite tired of all the selfies and actually wonder whether this friend has so much storage on the phone 🤣🤣

After sharing the good news, I have peers telling me that ntu cs is only second grade to nus and is always known as the nus reject where cmi people go. Or that the syllabus is way outdated and a relative waste of time with poor teaching. Even worse, that ntu cs grads are not as respected by companies in the workplace even to SMU as reflected in the GES and will be 2nd class citizen in the office just like a nurse to a doctor. I also shared that I was interested in ECDS but was shot down that these data science courses are only fluffs built upon the excitement of technology boom and will soon die out and become irrelevant.

I know that my friends are simply just giving me their genuine thoughts and advice, and are not looking to bring me down. But I can't lie and say that after a while all these negatives have really started getting to me, and making me question this joy if I should put my eggs in this basket.

CS seniors, do you really have such regrets joining this course? Doesn't help that I'm conflicted on whether to appeal to ECDS as well, as the economics concept interests me plus i'm not that sure on a full blown programming commitment, though I acknowledge that cs grads can do the jobscope of ecds but not vice versa.

Add: Thank you so much everyone for the kind words and overwhelming support on the situation. I’ve read through all the comments and though I can’t reply to every single one, I’ve come to strengthen my belief that others’ thoughts are others’, and mine are mine.

 I emailed the company directly for the internship opportunity and stated my availability which was the full 12 weeks of my summer break. After a month they replied and told me they the department is open for intern and it was a role which I’m keen to pivot into after graduation. 

My first round of interview was 2 weeks before my 12 weeks of summer break starts and after 2 weeks of no updates, I emailed HR and they explained that the hiring manager was out of town and subsequently scheduled the final round of interview with me the next following week, at this point it was already 2 weeks into my 12 weeks of summer break so I only had 10 weeks left. 

During final round interview, the manager ask when I commit til and I say i can only commit til aug since sch starts and he said they will discuss further and let me know by this week and today I received an email telling me that i got rejected because they needed me to commit full 12 weeks but I have less than 12 weeks to commit now because this whole process took so long.

There are many post from others who is thinking of dropping out and feeling so lonely in such a crowded big uni. I was one of those post under a throwaway account.   
During entry into uni, it was still covid thus no physical orientation and heck, I even forgot about the online orientation date thus didn't attend. I wanted a fresh start and a nice interesting university life, it wasn't. I came from Business Information Technology diploma and assumed this degree would be similar, I was not prepared for the math so much that I failed both my math module in year 1 sem 1 even though math was my strong suit. I was utterly devastated and wanted to drop out. I still 'had' friends who would study after class for a few session but I just wasn't the study type like them so we drifted away. Ignoring the 2 failed math mod, I started my GPA at 4.0, looks impressive but spoiler alert, I graduated now at 3.02.   
For the next 2 semester, I no longer had friend in uni, I was in a toxic relationship and saw a semester GPA of 2.0, I was called to meet my mentor or whatever that role is (those we know, know how useless it is). I wrote a few post on throwaway account seeking help here in this subreddit, asking if anyone want to be friend or should I just drop out. I dont know how but I was just drifting through this period of time trying to stay afloat and not break my parent's dream of me graduating from a local university which is a first for my family.   
Over time during the next 2 years of uni, I was just constantly thinking of dropping out and feeling the wave of loneliness when I walk by north spine with everyone in groups or their friends chatting and having fun while I'm there, I'm right there beside everyone but the whole university felt like a ghost town to me.   
I slowly made the change to seek out new environment to be in, extend my network and get to know more people outside of uni. It was slowly getting better knowing this period of 'uni life' doesn't have to focus on uni. I hardly physically go to uni anymore and skip out on work while doing bare minimum and putting my hardest for group projects since I do not want to drag others even though I'm dragging myself down.   
Soon after it was internship which was a really great change of pace for me and then FYP came and I was glad my professor helped me throughout the way. Before I know it, I am now reading the email of application for convocation. I know I will be there with no friend from uni but I am doing it for myself and my parents to see me graduate.  
Hope one day for those who are struggling or feeling lonely in uni can push through too and somehow you are graduating as well. ",177,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1ddn7fn/not_a_motivation_propaganda_just_a_summary_of_4/,2024.0,6.0,

Yes I managed to find a job before I graduated. But I worked there for a month before realising it was not a good fit in terms of job scope. I left. I spent a few months looking before being able to land another contract job before the year ended. (both are in the govt sector btw)

Well I stayed for a few months before I resigned again, without another job lined up. First few months were great, my bosses were quite supportive which motivated me to stay (and rejected a solid FT offer from another co). Then shit happened and I found myself constantly being gaslighted and belittled by the same bosses who I realised baited me with their fake generosity and kindness. at one point i was crying in the office almost every week lol.

so yeah, moral of the story is, it's better to stay unemployed (or at least work pt) and have a somewhat intact mental health, than to rush into a toxic work environment for the income and destroying yourself in the process. take your time, if it's meant to be yours then it will be yours.",162,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1d9m3s8/for_graduating_students_if_you_havent_found_a_job/,2024.0,6.0,

So, I'm from ADM, currently going to y3, I've been in around 6 CCA clubs and participated in multiple events, so you can say I'm quite involved as a person when it comes to campus life. Here's my advice as a senior, to everyone who are feeling nervous about starting uni life!

1) **Be not afraid** : Starting uni is so nerve-wracking. You are gonna be overwhelmed by a whole new system, Group projects, orientation etc etc. It's only natural, to feel nervous and believe you might not do as well as you expected. The thing about uni life, especially in year 1, is that it's rigorous and tries to introduce you to challenges all at once but the key to getting over it, is to 
- Seek support from fellow peers and instructors 
- Take breaks , constantly stressing over academics will leave a bad taste even after accomplishing goals and cause burnout 
- Make use of resources, the study spaces, the convenient food options, events that give you freebies, just try to integrate and assimilate with the environment.
- Try to find people who share similar interests as you and join clubs that appeal to you as well 

2) **Ask** : Don't be hesitant when it comes to asking questions about courses. This app is really good when it comes to answering very specific questions about the mods. Feel free to ask your instructors to help you out, there's even a CommsCube to help you out with assignments and stuff and don't shy away from using these things because these are all there for your own benefit 
https://www.ntu.edu.sg/lcc/about-us/lcc-communication-cube

3) **Don't overdo** : We all wanna outshine and be the best. But there's a fine line with doing everything and getting extremely exhausted and burnt out from work. Don't join too many CCA's, stick to one or two per year. Try not to overload everything at once, it is seriously not worth it. There should be room for self reflection and enjoyment and one shouldn't limit themselves to just uni life. Hang out with friends, read books, travel and taking that time off, really inspires even more creativity and thinking. 


4) **Health is wealth** : Most overused sentence but the amount of people who started pulling all nighters after joining uni is concerning. Hey, if you pull all nighter one day please atleast catch up on it the next day. Don't leave things for last minute or if U do, prioritise things that are due more earlier or important. Sleep is important and eating healthy is too. Don't stick to just fast foods or instant food. There's even some healthy options at convenience stores and supermarkets now. Take care , not just of Ur physical health but also your mental health.

Lastly, do attend all the career events, cultural and art events (usually at North spine ) and hey, NTU FEST is coming back this August and it's gonna be filled with fun and multiple activities for you guys to enjoy so do come !!


**What apps should you install?**

1) NTU OMNIBUS : Good for checking bus timings , usually updated 
2) Cates ; Ordering food from eateries 
3) Intellect : NTU has partnership with this app and all students get free access to premium materials and can even book sessions with counsellors. 
4) Canva : Good for presentations, collaborating with people (you can use your NTU email for education purposes)
5) Notion : Good for organising purposes (NTU also has tieups with this )

I didn't think much about this case until my JCRC friends brought up the latest mothership article with the criminal verdict and it was so disgusting how NTU covered this up and let the guy get away scot-free? 

As hall council, hall safety has always been one of my biggest concerns. And it angers me painfully that this case was swept under the rug by NTU (inserted their Straits Times statement). 

Heard the update that the guy that committed this act is back on campus as well and allowed back into various CCAs. He even posted this awful caption that seeks to elicit sympathy and made himself sound like the victim. 

What's even more shocking to me is the amount of people sympathising with him in the comments because he's quite pops? Every single one of these people should be placed on a watchlist.  

Why do we keep giving major leadership positions in NTU to people of questionable character? And why did Mothership censor his name even though Straits' Times released it already?

TLDR, didn't enjoy my degree at all, struggled my 3.5 years (even though i'm DY2, extended another sem), had to take supplementary papers after my last sem because i failed 2 mods. graduated with slightly above 2 GPA.  
  
started job hunting only in march (yes late, because i wasn't even sure i could pass my supplementary papers). i wanted to pivot out of engineering because i was very sure this wasn't what i wanted to do as a career. i have a keen passion in business operations and strategy, liked the idea of rotation thus applied for mostly graduate programs and management associate roles! 

some background about myself: in my 3.5 years in engineering i only did one professional internship but i mentored and volunteered for a non-profit organisation consistently (weekend and weekdays) for the last 4 years. was in a sports CCA and played SUNIG and IVP. 

sent out close to a 100 resumes, but each of my resume's objective was curated to the role/company i applied. landed about 5 interviews, 2 of which proceeded to the final round and i was finally offered a MA role for a MNC :') 

nothing to boast, in fact this whole process was full of doubt and many what ifs (what if i changed my course, what if i took up more internships etc). to all those struggling in school, YOU WILL MAKE IT. a bad grade isn't the end!!!! attitude is key and what employers look out for, how you carry yourself is important. uni isn't easy and don't do it alone.

Honestly I’m still on the fence and I want to get some insight from people who were in a similar situation like mine. 

For context my offers for ntu and nus were for econs.

The only reason why I chose NTU was that apparently it’s easier to get hall + less admin hassle. Also from what I infer, it seems easier to do well here with less competition. But apparently hall is not guaranteed for freshies? My main worry is that I plan to go to grad school and from what I heard, NTU isnt looked upon favourably for economics by Ivies/Oxbridge. 

I know this sounds silly but I just really don’t want to make a wrong choice where come a few months time, I don’t wish to end up thinking “should I have just went to NUS instead?”

Study tips: Take down whatever notes your prof write , don’t be lazy and procrastinate ( ask your questions to prof/TA directly or through emails ) Most of them are really helpful and profs are willing to arrange for physical consultations.

Also , never do last minute study. We can start studying for a test / finals early and doing a few chapters per day so that we give our mind to consolidate all the new information. Afterwards, challenge yourself to write out the information that we have recalled without referring back to our notes . Practise this again and again, you will definitely be more confident in yourself. Don’t think that your questions are stupid because clarification is better than ignorant . 

Sometimes , people may say people who are actively participating in tutorials are class sluts but when you are more engaged , you tend to be more interested in the topic

I also face some heartbreaks in school , it affected me a lot until the point I felt depressed and no mood to study. It’s tough very very tough , sometimes we may look at the past and ask ourselves why this happen. I ran almost everyday at SRC wave in school and this keeps me motivated. I became more introverted last sem but I was glad I have the support from my good friends. It is important to share our thoughts or inner feelings with people if not it gets worse till people may commit suicide or have no will to live. 

Wah, how come all my sem in NTU seem to be a new challenge. My GPA is decent 
4.26 to 4.43 to 4.48 and to 4.44

So is my goal FCH? Maybe ? But now I am not striving for FCH as much as before in Y1 or Y2S1. Sometimes I will prefer good health over grades. Good health be it mental or physical health, I hope those who are reading these take some time to relax and chill before next sem starts again , always find meaning first before mugging so hard for grades. Grades aren’t everything, the will we have to stand back up from setbacks are what it takes that will push us further in life.

I will be answering them from the perspective of an incoming Y2 Business student who took part in almost all of the above, but do take the answers as a pinch of salt as they may not be representative of the entire narrative! 😊

This girl constantly left period blood on the toilet seat, left me in the hostel room with a clogged toilet filled with her 💩 before which I had to deal with, and has extremely terrible body odour.

But I put up with her for months because it’s difficult to swap my roommate.

This is the part I need help with - 
When NTU assigned the hostel fees, it was split evenly between us, and written down in text too.

However, this mf checked out 1.5 days early without telling me, and she’s expecting me to PAY HER BACK for the TWO days 💀💀 (for context: it’s Europe so it’s almost $180 SGD….)

The admin staff during exchange and my friends told me to ignore her because I don’t have an obligation to pay her back, but she’s been spamming me everywhere and borderline being harassing. (She found my NTU email on the NTU registry too after I ignored her texts) 

After one month, she got NTU involved to “mediate” instead of letting the issue go.

Buses terminates at Saraca for Blue, Hall 11 for Red. And there’s no empty replacement bus from the last stop, they only start from the next stop. 

Where the buses are all coach buses(except for 2 City Bus & a few low entry ones), squeezing through the crowded narrow aisle with your bag and theirs.

The empty seat on the crowded bus, is definitely missing a seat cushion or occupied by some boxes. At times, we dislike sitting on the front seat that has the wheel arch. 

Getting “kiap” by the door is so common then. You can see this appearing on UWave almost every month.

It will be effective from AY2024/25 and supersedes the existing S/U Option Policy.
 
The FGO aims to empower NTU students with greater autonomy and flexibility to shape their academic journey. Through the FGO, students are provided a safe space to try new courses, without having to worry about its potential impact on their CGPA. This encourages students not to be too focused on grades, but rather to seize every opportunity to stretch themselves and explore new areas outside their core discipline.

FGO allows students to convert the grades of eligible courses to Pass or No Record grades, which are excluded from the student's cumulative GPA (CGPA). 
 
Students can declare the FGO on eligible courses taken in any semester during any declaration period before their graduation, subject to the quota of FGO Academic Units (AU) for their degree programmes. 
 
After the FGO declaration, grades will be converted to Pass/Fail.

Following the declaration, students' CGPA for the latest semester will be recomputed to reflect the FGO-declared courses. Students will only receive AU for FGO-declared courses with Pass grades.

The FGO can be applied to up to 12 AUs for three-year, four-year degree programmes (except Biomedical Sciences) and five-year programmes, and up to 9 AUs for direct entry programmes and Biomedical Sciences programme.
 
The FGO can be applied to:

1. Broadening and Deepening Electives (BDE): Courses to broaden and deepen students' learning experience

2. Major Prescribed Electives offered with a BDE option (MPE-BDE): Selected courses that undergraduates can take for specialisation in a particular degree programme or to broaden your learning

Source: NTU Intranet

TLDR: We can now S/U up to 12 AUs after seeing our AY24/25 Sem 1 course results. However, eligible courses are limited to Broadening & Deepening Electives (BDEs) & Major Prescribed Electives (MPEs) with an BDE option.

Well, guess what? Every single day I've been in school since this semester started, I have been approached at least once by these people again. 

That's genuinely fking CRAZY. HOW HARD ARE THESE PEOPLE HUNTING??? I'm getting approached literally every single day!

If you belong to any christian society or bible study group that is an NTU club, and you know members who are doing this, REIN THEM IN. This isn't the proper way to perform any form of outreach, and I say that while being a Christian myself.

Just 5 minutes before posting this, I got approached by another girl who called herself Eileen who tried to tell me about the same stuff, so I just cut her off and told her that I know what she's gonna say, and I am already a Christian and have my own care group.

I just want my quiet time during lunch and my study time to be uninterrupted. I hate explaining everyday to random strangers that, yes, I'm already a christian, and no, I do not need a bible study group. 

EDIT: BROOOO I GOT APPROACHED AGAIN. THAT IS TWICE WITHIN A 30 MINUTE PERIOD. STOP THIS NONSENSE. ",177,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1exjf0e/roaming_christian_duos_are_back_again/,2024.0,8.0,

Dear fellow Singaporeans, this should already be automatic in a crowded bus. Please place your damn backpack on the floor and please move towards the end of the bus. Please!!!

International freshie here
Sorry for the rant but I do need some advice!

I’m financially poor (from a single family with lower than $800/mth income) so applied to a bunch of bursaries & study loans. 
Did manage to get a few.( that’s the main reason why I accepted the offer & matriculated)
For context, it’s ocbc tuition fee loan & another half-loan half-grant scheme in my home country.

Enrolled into econs without studying econs before. 
My mother was stressing out & struggling because of me . We both cried a lot recently lol.
Especially we’re currently facing difficulties finding a surety for my tuition grant. If no one can help it’s gonna be 40k$ per year and we totally won’t be able to afford it, and I’ll definitely drop out after that,which means I’ll have to pay 20k$ for sem 1 still.

Now stressing about studies& financial difficulties &mental health 

Should I just drop out in teaching week 2 since they wont charge me a full semester of tuition fees? Although I understand some fees may be charged still. It’s better than slowly crushing my mentality.

Thanks in advance!


update: 
one of my mom’s friends said they can be a surety, but will need my mom to withdraw her bank savings and open a joint account together with him(total sgd 50000 )

 I don’t think I should be selfish cuz it’s almost all of my mom’s savings. It’s a big amount.

So currently I’ll be looking for other unis, although it’s so frustrating that all my efforts became wasted, at least I can study peacefully without big concerns!

Update 2:
I’ve submitted my withdrawal and contacted my mentor, still not out yet tho! ",137,70,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1evd4kq/thoughts_of_dropping_outwithdrawing/,2024.0,8.0,

If you insist on doing an education outside of Malaysia but have little to no funds, there are options. 

German public universities - choices for english bachelors are few but free even for internationals. Avoid the private ones and be aware that some public ones will charge you. Also try to avoid the big cities, rental is killer out there.

Needs blind universities in America. Unfortunately the universities that offer such aid is limited to the most competitive types like Princeton. But, should you get in, you would get a full ride education.

The last option, which admittedly would be somewhat insane if feasible, would be to do an online masters at CU Boulder. You will be limited to the few options they offer, but, it only costs USD15k for the entire programme and you don't need a bachelors to enter. It is risky though as you won't be admitted unless you pass the first 2 courses which you must pay for.

Good luck figuring this out. My dms are open, I'd like to help if you want it.",57,0,,2024.0,8.0,

Tried to take an exemption test for SC1003, followed all the instructions, and pretested the website (HackerEarth) the day before (Friday) to make sure I was able to do the test, according to the instructions. The test was an hour long and the window to begin it was also exactly an hour; there was no margin for error. If I found issues, I could've gone home to do it on another laptop since it was on a Saturday (today), but nothing was awry.

FF to the test window, I launch the test, and the website hits me with an error that wasn't accounted for in the pretesting instructions, which prevents me from proceeding. I follow the on-screen troubleshooting from the website but it doesn't work out. So, I immediately e-mail my prof going back and forth trying to troubleshoot the problem, and eventually the window lapses. He then offers to let me do the test in person, so I rush over to the venue.

I get to hardware lab 2 and explain who I am to whom I assume is a lab tech, and he seats me at a desktop to do the test. I start the clock and almost immediately, I have another issue, and so I call on the lab tech. He tries to diagnose the problem (2-3 mins) but gets stuck and calls the prof. It takes him another 5-7 mins to arrive and realize that I was trying to edit the pre-written read-only code within the editor (I had never used HackerEarth before, so I didn't realize), which derails my train of thought. This is especially detrimental to me as I already have trouble with my train of thought, which causes me to have spasms if I don't accommodate for it properly. At this point I'm already very unfocused and annoyed especially at the tone of the professor and the fact that I can't edit that code, but I continue with the test.

The first question goes smoothly (took about 10 mins), but I spend an excessive amount of time on the second question trying to figure out why my program fails on one of the test cases, and so the test ends (ig this means I failed).

While preparing to leave, the lab tech from earlier snarks ""better check your laptop next time"".

(Paraphrasing here)

\[Me\]: Yeah. (My mind's still working on the code lol)

\[Lab tech\]: Looks like you don't know how to use your own laptop.

(I think the prof told him about everything)

\[Me\]: I followed the pretesting instructions yesterday, I didn't find anything wrong.

\[Lab tech\]: Then how come your camera like that? (The problem was with my mac's webcam)

\[Me\]: The instructions said nothing about my camera and I was able to start and finish the practice test. Why wasn't it in the instructions?

\[Lab tech\]: There were 60 students, you are the only one with problem.

\[Me\]: Which means you'll just ignore the issue?

.

.

\[Lab tech\]: You had problem, so the prof and I let you sit this test here.

\[Me\]: So you just want a ""thank you""? You do realize if the instructions were better, I wouldn't be having this problem at all, right?

\[Lab tech\]: I could have just ignored it and let you do SC1003.

\[Me\]: Wow. You really sunk my opinion of NTU just by that line alone, and I've only been here a week. What is your name?

\[Lab tech\]: If you have so much problem here, why don't you study somewhere else?

\[Me\]: Did you really just say ""just don't study at NTU""?

\[Lab tech\]: (Says something but avoids the question)

\[Me\]: No, just tell me, true or false. Did you just say that?

\[Lab tech\]: (Keeps avoiding the question)



I want to escalate this issue, but I don't know how and I don't know who the lab tech is.

I've already been experiencing other issues at NTU like online lectures having 500+ participants, leaving no room for interaction. If the only thing I'm allowed to do is ask one-line questions through Q&A's, why wouldn't I just watch the pre-recorded lectures that we're required to watch and just pose my doubts to chatGPT? I'm really struggling to understand why NTU is so highly ranked.

1269.0,Comment,1etw1oa,Singapore's Wooden Building of the Future Has a Mold Problem,qwertygeeky,2024-08-17 02:24:03+00:00,"When the Gaia building at Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University opened last year, it was heralded as a revolutionary step toward a greener future. The massive structure—450,000 square feet—was constructed from sustainably harvested timber beams and panels. But these days, students and faculty are more focused on an unexpected downside: mold sprouting from all that wood. “It makes me feel a little grossed out,” says fourth-year student Grace Ng.

The problem highlights issues that can bedevil timber structures worldwide. While companies from Walmart Inc. to Microsoft Corp. have explored wood as a sustainable construction material, moldy timber in buildings has contributed to sickness, damage and legal battles from London to Melbourne.

Producing materials such as cement and steel is responsible for about 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Trees, by contrast, absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, and when their wood is used in construction, that carbon remains sequestered. The supplier of the wood for the S$125 million ($94 million) Gaia building says the structure stores more than 5,000 tons of CO2, after accounting for shipping.

But what looks good on paper has gotten a reality check in tropical Singapore, where it rains about 180 days a year. The wood in Gaia is primarily Austrian spruce, which was used to manufacture so-called mass-engineered timber—superthin layers glued into panels and beams that can be fashioned into columns, walls, roofs and more.

The Unexpected Downside of Eco-Friendly Wood Buildings: Mold
The trouble is spruce has a lower resistance to mold than many other species. In a place where relative humidity frequently reaches 80%, spruce that’s not properly treated is vulnerable to mold and rot, says Andrew Wong of the International Wood Culture Society. “It’s basically a climate problem,” Wong says. “We’re in the tropics, and that requires special attention.”

But such problems aren’t confined to the tropics. Desert climates have huge variations in temperature, which can cause excessive expansion and contraction of wood, ultimately cracking it. In subzero climates, water can get into gaps and freeze, splitting timber elements. Engineers must take all of that into account when designing timber buildings, says Erik L’Heureux, associate professor of architecture at the National University of Singapore. “There are limitations and challenges to each climate,” he says.

Singapore has used mass-engineered timber in 20-plus projects in the past decade, and more than 30 companies there have begun or completed projects with it. Singapore officials, though, haven’t said whether other buildings are suffering mold problems.

Singapore’s colorful shophouses—two- and three-story colonial-era buildings with ornate plasterwork—feature beams made from hardwoods native to the region, which have a natural resistance to mold. But such wood is difficult to find and costs far more today than in the 1900s, when most of the shophouses were built.

Oil palm plantations have replaced many Southeast Asian forests, making chengal–the hardwood traditionally used in Singapore–scarce. And it’s ideally harvested after about a century, while spruce can reach maturity in a third as long. Hardwood is rarely used in big projects, because “it’s really expensive,” says Loh Kee Soon, a lead architect for Gaia at RSP Architects Planners & Engineers. To use such timber at scale, “you’d need a very large forest,” he says.

While the problems might have been mitigated by thicker protective coating, Loh’s team rejected that out of cost considerations and because they wanted to highlight the grain of the natural wood. Larch, a softwood with greater resistance to mold, would have been pricier, so Loh used spruce, cladding the columns most exposed to sun and rain with larch.

There’s little argument about the aesthetic value of Gaia, which houses the university’s business school. The building’s 700-foot-long facade curves gently, its interior resembling a giant ski lodge bathed in natural light, with lush gardens tucked into internal courtyards. The ground floor is breezy and open, with no doors at the entrances.

More than a dozen conversations with students and staff who use the building, though, yield disgust, humor and concern about the problem. One staffer says he avoids his office because he’s afraid the mold will aggravate respiratory issues. “If the mold is just ugly, it’s not an issue,” says student Lifei Shan. “But since it can cause health problems, the school has to clean it up.”

The first thing visitors see and smell is the fragrant Austrian spruce that makes up the bulk of the building. Joey Feng, a mold inspector from a company called Air & Odor Management, isn’t impressed. Spotting white flecks that look like dust on a wooden pillar, Feng takes a sample with a swab and dips it into a clear liquid that turns lavender, indicating mold. She later finds more growth on air vents, which risks spreading it through the building. “I would treat this room immediately,” she says.

The school and architect Loh note that mold isn’t rare in humid Singapore, and they say it’s unlikely to affect structural integrity. Nonetheless, the school has developed “comprehensive” maintenance plans for Gaia, including reapplying sealant on the timber, adjusting the air-conditioning and asking staff to keep windows closed to reduce condensation. Experts in the field suggest treating surfaces with bleach, applying heavier coatings on the wood, installing dehumidifiers and running the AC 24/7, though that would make the building less sustainable.

“I can’t think of anywhere on Earth you could not use mass timber, if it’s designed for that particular climate,” says Art Schmon, an analyst at timber consultant Forest Economic Advisors. “The disadvantage is that it increases cost. Is it still competitive with steel and concrete? That’s a separate question.”",70,0,,2024.0,8.0,

As students of NTU and/or that are paying school fees, we are rightfully entitled to convenience of transport with the campus riders. However, this is not the case. The bus stops are always full of people waiting for any campus shuttle, eventually potentially needing to give up on going up the bus because people are literally being squashed to the point the bus doors can barely close. The students are then left to watch as bus 179 arrives repeatedly while the bus stop gets even more crowded with people. Moreover, even with continuous feedback there have not been not any actions made to improve the situation of there not being enough buses to ferry the students around. 
Hence, considering the fact that there are students of 2 institutes of higher education that mostly rely on the campus riders to get around school, a suggestion made is to allow NTU & NIE students to ride buses 179 and 199 for free, or at a very discounted rate, through the use of the mateic card. This would allow students to get to their destination more quickly, solve the problem of the insufficient number of campus riders, as well as improve the welfare of the students by not forcing them to squeeze into the buses.",70,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1expaoq/petition_for_ntu_students_traumatised_by_campus/,2024.0,8.0,

Basically no change from what it was in the past, except we can see our grades first before deciding.

MPE-BDEs can be FGO’d, yes, but it means that the MPE is now considered a BDE. So my BDE requirement count decreases but my MPE one stays the same. If I was taking this module as part of my MPE requirement, I would need to take another module to clear this requirement.

NTUSU's main weapon has always been their nepotism and voting for each other, which always skews the elections in their favour.

This matters because the current union has been using OUR school fees to do stupid things like bUyiNG FAnCy cAmErAs and alcohol (the proof will be detailed in the google doc link below)

Not only that, in this past week, they've been kicking out anyone that called them out for their budget usage and nepotistic culture.

Please forward the Google doc below, which contains evidence of their years of manipulation, doxxing, toxicity and budget embezzlement, which they've been trying desperately to shove away for years.

As many of the SU roles are co-opted, he has been going around looking for successors for these roles even though these roles are meant to be free and open for all to be elected in.

To my understanding, this guy has started policy meetings (since he is VPP and aspiring VPP again), assuming he will get a free pass and elect as VPP again unopposed.

Here is my plea to all students: PLEASE DO NOT VOTE THE NEPOTISTIC CIRCLE IN.

To all ACC presidents and NACC presidents: PLEASE DO NOT ELECT IN THE SAME CIRCLE (ie Edison, Dominic, Darren, Ebenezer)

My two cents, due to such circumstances it should be mandated that the president or the vice president of the student club NTUSU should come from the college with the largest representation of the student body, which is COE.

EDIT: Yea I think these claims seem quite blown out of proportion… Just looking through the accounted expenditures they add up to approximately just over 100k for 1 semester so let’s generously 300k for a year? Where’s the millions…

EDIT2: Not sure on the possible impact that 300k could have with financial aid. Using some napkin math, even if 300k was utilised to subsidise food for financial aid, eg 2$ per meal subsidy that’s 150k meals. If 3k students qualify for financial aid, that’s just 50 meals subsidised per student. Which would last approximately 25 days assuming you’re subsiding only lunch and dinner. Doesn’t seem very sustainable IMO.. And that’s if 100% of budget went to this…",15,0,,,,lms7jej

This was how much they used in a single semester last year, with 15k going towards an unspecified “other expenses” 😭 Now imagine how many batches of unions there were….its easily in the millions already.

But let's say it's 300k for just one year, I'd rather the funding go towards a few underprivileged students' tuition fees, or some food subsidies, than just aimless clubbing events gathered towards a minority or to a highly-exclusive orientation that picks people based on looks. There are some student clubs in NTU already gathering $10,000 to sponsor lower-income students, that have already been making a difference.

Like you're saying that you'll never win when saying it's not racist. So as a consequence you'll just make me happy by saying that it's not racism which was what you said in the first sentence. I'm not too sure what to take away from that.

I'm also from Social Sciences but not soci so pardon my lack of understanding and if I jump the gun in my chain of logic for this. As for power dynamics and history. In short, is it just the implication that racism essentially brings systemic discrimination and suppression towards certain groups for a trait that they have no control over. And this would naturally have far reaching effects generations into the future which is where we are now, and the problem does still persist to every extent. So is it being implied that for innate negative prejudice against a group to be perceived as racism or harmful, it must carry that history of oppression. Without that history and existence of an oppression dynamic, innately antagonising a group based on race is not defined the same and not harmful.",1,0,,,,ln7fkhe

Edit: Noted that you added the part about the NTU SU after. I honestly have not kept up with it other than the group chat message. I think my stance on it is pretty generic and the comment was never really about them. It was about the labelling of the chinese race as all being bigots.

My thoughts on the situation are just that it's improper and proliferates negative stereotypes, especially for a person in a position of power. People who initially disagree with it might end up agreeing just to stay in good graces with the others in the group. If such a dynamic exists, especially within a group chat that supposedly represents the student body, it's vile.

I wasn't even sure what race you were, and it did not matter to me when I was approaching the topic of overgeneralisation of the chinese. I don't think two wrongs make a right. Just because some people in the group have discriminated against you doesn't mean it's right to do the same. That was the main point I was establishing.

,Comment,1flyv5f,Establishment wins again ,premierfirz,2024-09-22 05:04:07+00:00,"To the user of this account,

I am Ahmat Firz, the candidate who lost the bid to run as SU president.

I am not sure what you hope to achieve by trying to namedrop those who matter dearly to me. They had contributed their efforts in helping me throughout this process and who I will remain eternally grateful and indebted to. But most importantly, they do not deserve to have their names splattered across online for the proposals I had strongly advocated for. I take full responsibility for the pledges I made during my rally and I hope you can refrain from putting undue pressure on others who were not running for the election.

This brings me to another point: the election is over. I lost and I will take it gracefully and honorably. In my communication with the new President, I had wished him the best in his leadership term and I hope the school can begin to heal and regain their trust in NTUSU. 

Yes, there is time for contention and disagreements - it is in the nature of humans to argue for what they believe in and at times that put people in opposing camps to persuade others on the merit of their ideas. But, we must also remain courteous and respectful in our exchange, to not foster hatred and ill-feelings against others. The words of Martin Luther King Jr. certainly ring true in this regard: ""Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that."" We can debate in the 'war of ideas' for what is best for the school, but we should also restrain ourselves and not fall too deep into realm of despair and hatred that only seeks to divide us than unite us.

Finally, I hope you can reflect on your action and become a more compassionate being - driven more by the compulsion of empathy and love, instead of enmity and hatred. Your soul as a human deserves more than it is now.

,Post,1fav3vd,How to Smurf Your Way Through NTU with a High GPA: Maximizing Value from University Resources,According--School,2024-09-07 01:04:36+00:00,"**TL;DR**: With a high GPA in NTU during Y1 and Y2, you can essentially ""smurf"" your way through the rest of the university by leveraging the many pass/fail options available through NTU’s exchange programs. GPA IS KING at NTU.

How can you get the most out of your NTU journey, focusing on exchange programs and pass/fail options? I’ll break down the ideal roadmap from Year 1 to Year 4 so you can extract the **MAXIMUM value** from your university life, assuming you’ve secured a solid 5.0 GPA in Y1.

# Why GPA Matters

If you’ve put in the hard work and achieved a high GPA in Y1, you can **unlock many strategic advantages** throughout the rest of your degree. NTU offers various exchange programs where you can pass/fail many of your modules, which is key to maintaining that GPA while gaining international exposure and clearing cores.

# Types of Exchanges and Key Programs

Here’s a rundown of the exchanges you should aim for to **maximize pass/fail opportunities**:

1. **NTU GEM VEnturer (Virtual Education)** You can pass/fail one of your **CORE/MPE** modules every year from Y2 onwards. YES, VIRTUAL EXCHANGE CAN PASS/FAIL ONE **CORE/MPE** But note, once you’re in GEM VEnturer, you can't do SUSEP or Overseas Exchange for that Semester itself you are on Gem VE.
2. **NTU SUSEP (Singapore Universities Student Exchange Programme)** Great for passing/failing your CORE/MPE modules, but also consider taking partial exchanges where you can clear as many modules as a full exchange.
3. **NTU GEM Explorer (Semester Exchange)** This is your standard overseas exchange. A great way to pass/fail your CORE/MPE while enjoying a semester abroad.
4. **NTU GEM Discoverer (Short-Term Programmes - Summer School)** Useful for clearing your **CORE/MPE** and also Broadening & Deepening Electives (BDEs). However, **Winter Studies under GEM Discoverer no longer allows pass/fail for CORE/MPE modules**.

# Ideal NTU Journey Plan

Here’s the optimal roadmap I’d follow if I were to reset my NTU experience:

1. **Year 1 S1**: Hardcore studying.
2. **Year 1 S2**: Hardcore studying, apply for NTU SUSEP for Y2S1.
3. **Year 2 S1**: Hardcore studying, apply for NTU VE for Y2S1 or SUSEP for Y2S2.
4. **Year 2 Winter Break**: Clear your BDEs via MOOCs or consider a Winter Exchange.
5. **Year 2 S2**: Hardcore studying, apply for NTU VE, SUSEP, Overseas Exchange or Summer School for Y3S1/S2.
6. **Year 2 Summer Break**: NTU Summer School.
7. **Year 3**: Relax mode if you’ve secured both SUSEP and Overseas Exchange or maybe you can go for one of the exchange program and complete your professional internship (PI) in one of the Y3S1 or Y3S2.
8. **Year 4 S1**: Apply for NTU VE for Y4S1 to pass/fail one CORE and start your job search.
9. **Year 4 S2**: Focus on job hunting.

# Why Am I Sharing This?

Many people are unaware of these NTU resources or don’t know how to fully utilize them. If you look on LinkedIn, you’ll notice many high-performing students have gone on multiple exchanges. I hope sharing this knowledge will help level the playing field and help others make the most of NTU’s offerings.

  
**Note**: This is just to inform you that NTU has these platforms to leverage your PASS/FAIL options, and how you utilize this to plan out your NTU journey is purely up to you. This serves as a possible reference point if you can maintain/achieve a high GPA throughout your NTU journey.

Good luck, and I hope this helps you smurf your way through NTU",504,54,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fav3vd/how_to_smurf_your_way_through_ntu_with_a_high_gpa/,,,

This is exactly what I’m talking about in my earlier post on CCDS “fostering academic excellence and integrity”. You’re da’ GOAT!  🫡👏💯 Students/faculty thinking students that do a makeup quiz and/or applying for coursework mark retention with valid LOA is a course for concern (mainly because they want to “abuse” the system to get an advantage over other students such as having more time to study for quizzes, etc.) totally missed out on this. 

My personal experience is that students who do makeup quiz and/or applied for coursework mark retention with a valid LOA are already facing struggles in coping with the content. This could be due to a series of tests scheduled in the same week (remember, not all CCDS students are taking on the same amount of workload, modules, or other commitments like family, part-time work to support living allowances, etc.). It’s extremely disheartening to see others not being understanding toward this group of students.   


NTU CCDS, you have better, more important things to focus on such as living up to your university’s purported standards, levelling up your teaching quality, content, and student engagement. Also, providing adequate student support and resources to students in need to close the gap for students who came in with weaker background in first year subjects like Math, Physics, Chemistry, etc.",18,0,,,,llw81gm

Also another thing you missed out is that SUSEP has way more slots for part-time which NTU never discloses. Ik ppl who have got in with around 4.4 or 4.5 GPA, so it's not a necessity to be 4.8+ unless someone is gunning for full-time SUSEP. Also for most engineering students, there is never a relevant core to P/F for NTU VE.

Also, from what I can tell from the post, this will only for work for humanities students, since for us engineering students we also have to deal with a lot of restrictions on courses that can be cleared outside, not to mention that we are not even allowed to go exchange in certain semesters. finally we have FYP to deal with.",17,0,,,,llwldvp

not worth to take full SUSEP in y2, as this means your GPA in NTU for that sem will be fully determined by ICC mods (ICC cannot postpone to later sems if I'm not wrong). this may have adverse implications on your GPA based on whether you're a ICC fan. I mapped only a single mod for local exchange.

the only other downside to this plan is high GPA does jacksh*t for securing employment. I personally hate doing extracurricular stuff just so to demonstrate to employers that I'm ""interested"", coz im alr putting in so nuch time and effort into maintaining my hrades. and if you're one of those ppl that do to inflate your resume, screw you honestly, coz I just see it as you couldn't fight on the same level (if you could, why's your GPA struggling?)

It would require some amount of money, if you are going on Summer/Winter schools or even Overseas Exchange. However, you can always choose to go to relatively less expensive countries in ASEAN to match your courses.

If you are on Nanyang Scholarship/other scholarships, there would be reimbursement for overseas exchange programs. I think for Nanyang Scholars, it would be $5000. Correct me if I am wrong.

Furthermore, SUSEP is free and iirc GEM VE is also free as well cos of your school fees.",24,0,,,,llwcegh

Also it isn't always necessarily the best option to go to the more prestigious universities as they put a minimum amount of courses that you are required to take and also their courses can be tougher -> more stress during exchange program even to just barely pass the course, which defeats the purpose for most ppl. for the engg schools, it's actually not that hard to find unis where can clear more courses, and their min. gpa requirement is also 3.3",2,0,,,,lm1mrtx

So, after joining some ori and talking to a load of people, I can't help but feel that everyone is friendly. Like, too friendly. A typical convo I have with people goes something like this: ""HiiiiXDXD What's your name? What course are u studying? OMGOMG me tooooo. What hall do you stay in? OMGG I literally stay opposite uuuu!!! OMG im sooo scared that i'll have no friends so letss be bestiessss yayy!!"" 

Ok maybe I'm exaggerating a little but yall get what I mean? Like hey I just met you, and this is crazy, I'll give you my number, but let's not get hasty. 

Everyone just seem so eager to network and make friends and idk what uncanny valley this is but I feel creeped out. I get the importance of having friends, but a couple of days ago, I got to attend a lecture that none of my ""friends"" attended and it felt like heaven to be alone. Now l'm even more tempted to ditch everyone and just be that lonely kid who sits alone because that was a lot nicer than whatever my this is. 

Was I just so unlucky that every person I met in uni is fake? Or is there some validity in me thinking that people are fake? Can anyone who act this friendly in school just let me know if you're fake?

TLDR: The people I interact with feel fake, are people nowadays just really that friendly and should I just get used to it?

Edit: Thanks for the insights guys. I think one conclusion I can come to is that I just do not fit in with people my age.

So you were at an event (orientation) meant for socialising, people tried to socialise with you, and somehow that's them being fake?

It helps to understand that it's a new stage of life for many people, and many people indeed are trying to network and find new people they can vibe and spend time with for the next 3/4 years. I wouldn't dismiss that as them being fake. I'd say fake friends are friends who only approach you because they have something to gain from you, like academically or financially, and wants nothing to do with you after you've given them what they want.

I've friends from my OG who have gone out of their way to include me in discussions, gatherings, taken initiative to have conversations with me, cared for my well-being etc. All the while we were just having fun and not being transactional. I think a huge part of that came from the few days of ori when we got the opportunity to bond with each other. I usually go to lectures by myself because not many people from my OG is in the same course as me. But when I do meet up with my OG friends, I really enjoy interacting with them.

I'd be wary of the mindset of pushing people away just for the sake of it, because I've been that person in the past, and it certainly made me feel bitter and angry irrationally, not just at myself but also at others. It feels much better letting more people into my life. I suppose whether people are really true friends, only time will tell, this is only the 4th week of sch and it's still early.",6,0,,,,llxxc06

Definitely, what I said wasn't meant to invalidate your experiences in any way, because everyone's uni experiences are different in their own right. It's just to emphasize what other people's perspective might be at an early stage of uni, and observing their behaviour tells us more about what kind of friend they are.

Personally I'm extra careful when I can sense that people are being too friendly, like the odd friendly kind. But that depends on the context too, whether that particular setting was for socialisation or not.

When you meet the right people, they'll treat you right and won't make you feel inadequate about yourself. I think I've felt some of that from my OG which makes me grateful I've met such people. So I suppose we gotta keep an open-mind, not keep people at an arms' length away or expect too much from others, but cherish friendship when we do have it with the right people.",2,0,,,,lly3mfm
,Post,1f78ia7,can we say thank you to the bus drivers pls,boozytiramisu,2024-09-02 14:45:04+00:00,"I know we're all damn tired and irritated by the ongoing bus situation in ntu, but for what it's worth, I think SBS/SMRT (idk which one it is now) is doing a pretty good job at supplementing the lack of ntu campus buses. I missed 3 buses today at 9.30pm, but I ended up only experiencing a 20 min delay which means there was an average of one bus every 5 mins.

I'm pretty sure the bus drivers also feel annoyed when they have to shout to get people to move to the back, shout everytime they open the doors for people to clear the way etc, and they get no thanks. The moment the bus reaches Pioneer, everyone is just focused on getting out and no one bothers to thank the bus driver. Can we try to show more appreciation to the bus drivers? They also have no choice and they're trying to look out for our safety.

If you want to be nice, you could tell him that so far, the reasons for missing classes have been valid and it's not your intention to skip class. You will make effort to catch up and take care of your health so as not to affect your learning negatively. 

Not so nice, you can add on - However, taking time off for valid reasons such as these is your right. 

Beyond not so nice - Even working adults have 14 day MC. If you have produced valid proof for your absence, is he implying there is a need for warning or disciplinary action for simply being human? And having human problems like falling sick? You would be open to correction if that's indeed the case, but would like to see the university administration confirm this in writing - that students are not allowed to miss classes for any compassionate reasons or illness. And you will be sharing that with friends and schoolmates on social media so as to raise awareness of such rules. 

Not nice at all - if he threaten to report you again for missing class over valid reasons like being ill and private matters - you will also submit a report to administration about having a professor whose working ethics should be called to question as it might not be aligned with the university's guidelines which means there might be a tendency for him to be partial in his grading towards certain candidates over personal issues.

,Post,1fgbzq8,"""Service with Transparency""",Unknown,2024-09-14 02:23:05+00:00,"As an ex-chairperson of NTUSU who has recently stepped down, I feel compelled to highlight some serious concerns about the organisation's internal operations. There is a troubling lack of transparency within NTUSU, even among its own chairpersons. Often, it feels like we're kept in the dark about what the executive committee is actually doing. For instance, my own VP appeared to be completely unresponsive, and I doubt they ever reviewed a single proposal we submitted. The President and HGS take an interminable amount of time to vet proposals, and when they do provide feedback, it’s usually just a cursory “good job.” This raises the question: what’s the point of having them review our proposals if their feedback doesn't add any real value?

Moreover, I’ve heard that some committees have bypassed the exco and gone straight to SAO because they’ve lost confidence in the exco's ability to handle their responsibilities effectively. This undermines the very essence of effective governance and raises concerns about the organisation's commitment to genuine service and transparency. Instead of promoting ""service with heart,"" it might be time for NTUSU to focus on ""service with transparency.""",310,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fgbzq8/service_with_transparency/,,,

Just wondering if I am the only one who feels like food prices are getting overboard in school. Idk about you all, but I am feeling the pinch….

$5 for Mee Soto @ Quad Cafe near Wee Kim Wee, and $1.90 for basic iced coffee @ Foodgie… Don’t even want to mention prices @ North Spine…

Are we supposed to just accept these prices? Food is now more expensive on campus than in regular neighbourhoods…. And we don’t have a student discount / price system?

Heck, some prices are comparable or even more expensive than stalls in SMU, a university in town… Are operators just making use of the captive nature of our ulu location to charge whatever they want? 

I know this could be less of a problem for well-to-do students, but the Karen in me feels like the prices are becoming very unfriendly for STUDENTS who are already paying so much for school/hall..",302,48,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1f7xr62/food_prices_are_getting_ridiculous/,,,

,Comment,1fkmigl,Destined to be alone,Eigenstatics,2024-09-21 02:01:49+00:00,">Every time I see couples in school, I just feel dead inside more and more.

You see what's on the outside, but don't know what actually happens in the relationship as an outsider. You don't know the quarrels they have. You don't know the sacrifices they have to make to sustain the relationship. You don't know if they're actually as happy as they look on the outside. In the end, it might not even work out. I've seen couples in my friend groups who seemed happy, only to have broken up suddenly later on, which gave me a reality check. Yes, there're many happy relationships out there, and we can be happy for those people, but don't assume it's always rainbows and sunshine.

>What’s the point of building an empire if there’s no one by your side since the start to enjoy with you?

This is similar to leaving your happiness, validation and meaning in life to someone else and expecting them to provide it. Which is doing yourself a disservice and is burdensome on that person. You do have the power and responsibility to take charge and provide it for yourself.",1,0,,,,lo5cd2g

Something like this eats you up from the inside, day by day. I was so tired of it these feelings of desperation, I tried to focus on self-improvement. And it felt liberating, like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.

Sometimes I still get a little distracted with those feelings of wanting someone intimate in my life, when I see couples holding hands or giving little kisses on each other's faces. But it helps a lot to remind myself of what I mentioned in my earlier comment and just be happy for them instead.",1,0,,,,lo5ygrh

Firstly, last week she uses 30mins and hides behind her assistant and leaves the class early to administer a survey for HER study (she told the class it’s a survey to help the school) and essentially uses us as a captive audience to try to milk survey responses. (Didn’t do out of principle as I didn’t like that we were used like that)

This week, she props up a screen with two QR codes and tells the class that people still can participate and if they want to scan the first qr. then she provides the non participants with the second qr saying it’s important to today’s class content. Both QR codes link to the same survey she tried to force us into doing last week.

Tbh how else will she get data if not from you guys? If she teaches well and she's a good prof I think the students should help her out too! And by using her class as her sample population, she doesn't have to soend additional funds to pay other NTU students to take her survey.

So lesser expenditure means her future funds might not be increased, and overall NTU spends lesser on her and in turn we mitigate another increase in school fees somehow, even if it's by a teeny weeny amount.

,Post,1fbnde7,Dealing with a clingy friend,zeph7rus,2024-09-08 02:16:33+00:00,"During orientation, I (24M) was a GL to a freshie (21M) who was initially very quiet and always on his phone. Being a mental health advocate outside of NTU, I tried to engage him with the rest of the freshies and the seniors, but I couldn't help noticing the sadness and depression in his expression. My instinct was right as he started sharing with me about problems happened in his part-time job just before orientation. Needing to juggle between him and the rest of our orientation group, I tried my best to listen to him and just told him to approach any of us if he needs help in school.

Sounds normal right? Well, in subsequent weeks after school started, he texted me almost every day that I'm in school to ask if we can meet for lunch. I had no issue initially as I thought it's just a normal meetup. After each lunch, I would meet up with friends who have the same class as me to go to the seminar room together. He would follow behind me most of the time on his phone. There was this one time where my friend told me about him following us, and had to leave us alone as it seems like this freshie has something that needs my help. However, the freshie just said he just wanted to follow me, and we only managed to split since our classes are in different venues.

There was this one instance where I lent him something he needed for an event (idk the specifics of that event). After the event, he texted me that he needed to rush to another class so would have to return my stuff to me real quick. Before I could text him to meet outside my seminar room, he has already opened my seminar room door and started looking for me. My friend and I were shocked about it, and I even told him that I'm trying to focus in class but he just dismissed it as ""I'm just a lost freshie lol"".

Now it's the piece de resistance. My orientation group holds gatherings sometimes, and I attend them regularly. This freshie would often sit beside me and as time passes have the habit of leaning his whole back onto my shoulder or back to rest. I felt very uncomfortable about it as I have dislocated my shoulder before but did not voice out as I was scared it might hurt his feelings since he's already going through so much in life. I tried to bear with it until I felt pain in my shoulder again upon leaving one of the gatherings.

I've told a few close friends about this issue but they told me to set boundaries. I would usually do it without hesitating but I'm very afraid of hurting him. However, my relationships with most of my friends have deteriorated dramatically in the past few weeks and started to see me in a different way. This has been affecting me physically, mentally and socially, and I've never felt more lonely in NTU than now.

So for those who has experienced clinginess before, how do yall set healthy boundaries without hurting your friend, especially about physical touch?

EDIT:

Took me a whole day of reflection to realise I only see him as a duty, since he's always there with my closest friends. My only way of avoiding him is to stop hanging out with my closest clique which is something that made me hesitate. However for the time being I decided to take a break from them altogether. Hopefully through this period of distancing myself from them he can learn not to be so withdrawn from people. It's a tough decision for me but it's necessary for me to get my life and relationship back at least.

Thanks everyone for your advice. Stay blessed",202,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fbnde7/dealing_with_a_clingy_friend/,,,

,Comment,1fbnde7,Dealing with a clingy friend,Visible-Broccoli8938,2024-09-08 03:09:10+00:00,"Dude. This is not doing any good for you and him. Is he going to spend his entire life in NTU seeking refuge in you and missing out on growth opportunities ie. Socialising, engaging in meaningful CCAs. How is him following you helping him in anyway if your intention is to help him? There is a difference between supporting a person to stand on their feet and enabling a person to avoid their problems. You are doing the latter.

You say you don't want to hurt his feelings but growing up is tough. Noone ever says it's easy. Take this as a opportunity for yourself to learn how to assert healthy boundaries and communicate clearly.

If you are a people pleaser / suffer in silence type person, you need to reflect on this and think of ways to be more assertive.

BTW it seems he knows your timetable to be able to cling to you?

I suggest the following -
Skip the orientation meetings for now. 

If he texts you for help, say you are unable to help him whether it is lending things or whatsoever. Just say, ""sorry I don't have it"" and always give at least half a day buffer before replying. 


Dont meet him if he asks you to. Say you are busy.

Anyway this is not a friend but a parasite.

I will suggest you sit him down and tell him in a nice way that you see him as a friend and that you hope he can connect with his course mates. Also let him know that being too physically close is uncomfortable for you. Lastly do let him know that his constant ‘stalking’ is making you and your friends uncomfortable.

That being said, as everyone else is saying, set your boundaries. I know it’s easier said than done and the last thing you want is to be the reason someone’s mental health has plummeted, but that on its own is not good for him (or you) 

You could first consider why you want to be friends with him. Is it to help him ? Do you guys actually get along ? Is there a friendship or do you feel like this is something you should be doing for him ? Assuming you don’t have intentions of becoming close friends with him, perhaps you could try to talk to him about this during one of the times he’s with you one on one. Let him know you’re there for him but he needs to expand on that circle of people he can be around. Ask if he has friends outside of uni etc etc. Let him know it’s concerning that you’re all he has. Maybe introduce him to a friend that might get along with him, or something to get the ball rolling for him. I have anxiety and I had a hard time starting off in school settings too so I’d stick to one person I deemed as ‘safe’. 

If none of this works, you’d unfortunately have to be more firm on these boundaries, and if even then it doesn’t work, it’s time to cut ties. At that point he isn’t healthy for you either. This ESPECIALLY goes for the physical touch aspect of this. 

Now, you could also just avoid/ignore him without doing any of the above things and hope he eventually gets the hint and goes away, but I feel that will hurt (and maybe even embarrass) him a lot more because he won’t know what he did wrong and he’ll be left having questions and needing closure he might never get. 

Again, it’s so awesome of you to be receptive and supportive to someone that struggles socially !! But this guy, like everyone else, has to have other options for when their friend isn’t available. You’re his friend, nothing more. :^)",4,0,,,,lm363cx

Im all out for anyone to join us but because I have observed the girl to be 24/7 depressing.. Always talking negatively.. Whenever my friend tried to cheer her up, she will either talked 'suicidal' or some depressing episodes that happened.. 

So I asked my friend, 'Are u sure?' 

Long story short, the friend found the girl's diary which included all of us.. Some shit abt how she felt alone in the group.. Suicidal.. etc...

The thing is I recognise my friends' efforts to include her in whatever they had planned out so I sat with the girl in library (I think) n told her to stop being an ass because she's gonna lose them. That her actions annoys me because that's not how u treat someone who wants to get close to u...

She probably had a heart to heart talk with a guy who has a crush on her n she got better afterwards. True story, they married each other hahaha

Set boundaries with your friend by saying 'listen bro, I was cool with u until u started being clingy with me. I enjoyed being your friend but right now it gets too much where I can get irritated just by your presence n I don't want that to happen.'

'Ure actually cool on your own. Why don't u see it?'

Something like that. I can't think of a nicer way to put it cause I'm not really a nice person😅

I just prefer to stay away from anyone who gives negative energy 24/7..",2,0,,,,lm2h0gp

She showed him abit of concern only, you know. He latch on to her sia. She kept avoiding him but dont dare to tell him straight cuz he has depression. Keep purposely want to sit beside her in cell group meetings, want to send her home, want to sit beside her during dinner when the cell group went out. And he likes her, even worse. Now she dont dare to ""anyhow"" give concern incase she kena like this again.

I think to tackle situations like this is to tell the person you are uncomfortable. My friend dont dare to say all these so she just keep avoiding until she change church (but not because of him la). 

But cannot be you change school mah right. I really think you need to tell him how you feel. It is what it is. Sometimes people dont know what is personal space so they always cross the line. Why are you suffering because of another person? Not worth it.",1,0,,,,lm5r7nx

As many have conveyed to me that they found my previous set of EWL Travel Alternatives infographics useful, alongside the fact that the disruption is likely to stretch over the next few days, I have decided to put together infographics for ALL stations along the disrupted/delayed sectors (Queenstown to Boon Lay), in addition to Pioneer. 😋

Suggested alternatives have been carefully considered, so as not to make each page overly cluttered. 

While I have tried, to the best of my ability, to minimise the occurrences of errors, there may still be some of these which I've overlooked - apologies on that! 🙏🏻

freshman in soh, and if youre here to say humanities is easy just do me a favour and shove ur phone or laptop up ur 

ok jkjk realistically i know its easier comapred to compsci or engineering or something but still

the whole uni system in general is so overwhelming, everything is still so new and we r expected to immediately know what to do?

maybe stemming from the stress that i missed one graded cc2 vlm (which ive been told isnt That big of a deal but still im like 😀😀) and am struggling to catch up with readings and lecture content

i know its alr week 4 so i dont really have any excuses... just trying to see if anyone relates or has felt like this before 🤓",178,33,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1f74dmu/didnt_expect_uni_to_be_this_overwhelming/,,,

I probably would hate every second of a humanities mod if I had to take one

But a tip that applies to everyone, regardless of major: stay one week ahead of content or you're already falling behind (or at least you'll be at an extremely high risk of falling behind)

Don't wait for deadlines to come to you, instead you should be waiting for the assignments to release and trying to complete them ASAP

plan how you spend your time. ensure you have at the very least 1 rest day.

readings can get overwhelming, so dont read all of it at one go unless you're one of those who can understand what you're reading in one sitting. if you aren't, then think of how you want to digest them bit by bit.

some days you'd want to skip your readings. my advice is read the intro & conclusion. skim through. get an idea of what is happening. that'll be more than enough. 

alternatively, get your group of friends to do readings together. can either do 1 reading/pax or 1 chapter/pax, depending on number of readings. create a google doc & all of you can contribute your reading notes. 

it's your first time in uni & just know you aren't the only one behind. struggling is normal it's just how you bounce back from it.

It is super painful to wake up for morning lectures :( Also, if the lecturer talk too fast and u missed it thrs no way to catch it again. And classpart too, so you have to put in effort to talk in class. I guess different majors have their different set of struggles so you are completely valid.

I assume you missed one of cc2's weekly lams (?), sorry if I forgot all the terms, but I took it last year and also missed one of the lams and still got a A-, so there is still hope :D

My advice is to just plan all the deadline on your calendar and check it every weekend to keep track of stuff you gotta do. Also, don't delay doing stuff, just start asap and your future self will thank you for it.

Definitely tell your profs/TAs if you're really struggling to keep up, though.

I empathise with how much you need to adapt to especially since you've just started. Just remember that this is a sign that you are being challenged, and that this is an opportunity for you to learn and grow. Struggle well and be patient with yourself!

Multiple choice exams? Okay. What are the details that are considered important in your major? Is it the theory, the numbers, the players?

Essay based exams? There usually is some element of choice in these. Check with your seniors on last year's testing format. That will give you a gauge on how many weeks material you will need to master.

Papers plus weelly writeups? This is the best. Choose your topics early, research that, screw the weekly readings (do 1 properly enough to write a reflection, skim the rest).

,Post,1fh40km,(Opinion) The last 2 years of NTUSU election saga makes a strong case for establishing partisanship in student government,H3NTA1B01,2024-09-15 04:07:40+00:00,"TL;DR: you all can keep talking about the corruption all you want, but a lack of any action to organize your demands and outline your plans for the school means you will inevitably never get what you want 


While it is commendable that the larger student body isn’t just going to let our student leaders lead without accountability, there is still an awkward lack of organization of coherent opinions and policies that some factions of the student body is demanding.

The ability of the ruling clique of students to still take office despite (online) protests and (amateur) investigative findings on their actions proves that any clique of students who are organised to a certain capacity will always be able to push forth their agenda. As long as a strong alternative voice to organise the opposition is absent, this will always be the case.

Yet, whenever it is actually time to step up to nominate themselves for office, the loudest voices often hide behind excuses such as “I very busy” or “aiya I one person also cannot change anything”, showing a pathetic lack of action that does nothing to better the situation we are in.

I urge juniors who are enraged over the lack of transparency and rampant cronyism that has plagued the Student Union for years to organize yourselves into parties that actually outline your plans on how to make the school better, and run for office on a united front together. An opposition party in response to the ruling clique, if you will.

The point of a student union is to make demands of the administration and organise the student body to gain leverage against the school. At the heart of this is solidarity and unity of student interests.

Having parties is a surefire way of diverting attention from union work, disrupting that unity, and making sure that the interests of minority and underprivileged students will be ignored unless they are assimilated and diluted into a majority.",1,0,,,,lnhzrn8

I honestly think they need to have a reboot for the SU. Kick those (including those in current positions)who are affilited with thise bad rumours. Have newer policies implemented. Also its very stupid to have the same person run for these major roles more than 1 time.  Have the school to oversee the SU as we are still considered maturing adults who did not step into the workforce. Hate to see people starting politics in schools literally manchild.

Learnt that there was going to be an air-con maintenance (as per the worker's words), no issue, thanked them, gave them cold drinks, went out for a while.  

Came back at 12+, to my surprise, was not just a simple maintenance/check, they were dismantling the air-con units of mine and the one next to me, and replacing the entire system with new ones. We were not told in advance and there was no plastic sheets given/placed to cover our furniture. My room and the room next to mine was already covered in plaster, no biggie, they said they would mop our floor for us, moved some of my clothes so they wouldn't get covered in even more plaster.  

Said they would be done at 4, came back, said they needed another hour. Went out for dinner and received a call from the Admin Office at 5 that the installation was done, and there would be a remote given to us for free air-con while they register the unit into the NTU Hall-Aircon app.  

Came back at 10, my entire table and the stuff on the table was white, floor not fully cleaned (still had that layer of dust on it), and air-con could not be turned on. Asked my neighbour and he said the workers told him that it was not complete, they have not installed the compressor etc.  

First sem here, quite frustrated, any idea what I should do (other than reporting one-stop SAC)?  

Anyone else also encountered this kind of issue where NOTHING was said in advance?

Something similar happened to me once. Those dudes came for Aircon servicing , left with my Aircon half broken. Asked hall office to get it changed. Took them 3 MONTHS TO CHANGE.

,Post,1fadhgb,CCDS Academic Policy Meeting with Deanery Outcome ,Faith-Creuset,2024-09-06 12:05:07+00:00,"As title suggests, I am part of the team that went to have a meeting with the deanery from NTU. We mainly discussed the pain points experienced by students with the revised academic policy from CCDS (tutorial marks)

Below are the solutions/recommendations that we gave CCDS' deanery and their replies.

Recommendations:

* Postpone policy this semester

Rejection: CCDS deanery stance is students who commit to a full time degree must commit to it by attending lectures / tutorials / labs

* Hybrid Tutorials

Rejection: Online classes are not conducive & students who commit to a full time degree must commit to it by attending lectures / tutorials / labs

* More indexes

Rejection: Lack of facilties and faculty for increased intake



Important things to note:

* College is moving towards major changes in curriculm and learning. New tutorial policy have led to high tutorial attendance, exams will now be harder.
* Removal of lecture recording is **not a confirmed thing and may or may not happen down the line**
* Exams will be harder



The pain points of students namely

* Distance from school affecting tutorial participation

Reply from Deanery: CCDS deanery stance is students who commit to a full time degree must commit to it by attending lectures / tutorials / labs

* Tutorial's inconducive due to noise:

Reply from Deanery: Tutorial Conduciveness is both a lecturer and students responsibility in maintaining the conduciveness

* Class Participation

Reply from Deanery: Due to class size making individual answering infeasible, being physically present will suffice in getting the 5 marks provided attenandce is within the specified 70% attendance.

CCDS Deanery Observation:

* Good attendance for tutorials ever since academic policy is implemented. CCDS deanery argues that students had the option to choose whether or not to attend tutorials, i.e. students are not forced to attend

Given that our petition has only 500 signatories, it is not a strong enough support since CCDS has 3000 students. Thus, we hope that we can get more support and feedback from y’all that’s affected by this by singing the petition and putting in suggestions to improve the system in the comments 

We will update y’all on our further progress

Maybe implement a mod/subject tryna help everyone crack technical interviews rather than making exams harder to weed out excessive 4.0s? I think many people would look forward to attend these type of mods or subjects that help u tackle these technical interviews and stuff. Like it gives a small exposure to put ur knowledge to test in a safe environment to make mistakes and learn. So that instead of only a few prodigies performing well in those interviews, it makes more people perform better?

Of course tutorial attendance is higher, it is being given marks. There is no neutrality in this. We are not given a choice though, you are punished for not attending by not having the marks. Its 2024, where technology is ever growing. This is a simillar mentality to CEOs making statements that employees must come to office to work instead of WFH.

That's why they implemented this new policy in the first place. So what are the factors that contribute to incompetency of CCDS students? Well, personally I think there are two factors: school accepts a lot more students, and professors are not smart enough to teach as good as top uni in the US, that's why some student just watch YT videos from Harvard or MIT (myself included).

And that's the thing I'm concerned about. That will genuinely hamper our ability to understand the content.

The problem is that certain programmes over-matriculate students. But this seems to stem from the directive of MOE because they dictate how many students each programme can admit. The trend is that CS admits more students while the other programmes admit fewer. Even the overall number of students may not increase that much, a big increase in a specific programme can already put a big strain on facilities -- more students are going to class around the same time, LTs may not be big enough, absurd number of small tutorial classes, etc. The buildings are 20-30 years old or even older and were not built with this size of students in mind.

About the small groups and student to teacher ratio - yes, and it is a effect of how little school fees NTU students pay. I know many here will feel insulted that I call NTU fees little, but the real cost of a university is \_\_astronomical\_\_. If you compare it to private US universities, not even top tier elite ones but solid ones like Northeastern, NYU etc - their fees are over 100k a year. How much NTU gets per student is 38k/year.

And there's the whole larger issues where even a reasonable person would strongly suspect you're lazy rather than genuinely concented about teaching quality/transport.

If so, use a textbook and don't even go to a university. Or go to an online one. There's much more to learning than that. It doesn't mean being physically present means you're learning in a good way, but it is a pre requisite. And a big reason there is no value add is because students have a study and zao attitude. You need two people to engage. There's a whole ton of stuff you will learn from a prof by just asking him what he is doing. We straight up have professors from Tsinghua, Stanford, Cambridge, UPenn, etc, with vast and extremely technical knowledge, profs who work to design major parts of internet infrastructure, etc. 

And I'm going to be real for a moment. There's two sides here. One side is pulling NTU towards being essentially a distance learning degree. Less engagement, a stale educational culture, less lesrning, and less meaningful in every way. There's the other side trying to push NTU to become a greater school in every meaning of the word. People in the first side do what they do because it's easy. It takes less effort. It's convenient. They don't want to think of real solutions and the real world. And if they actually got their way, the value of what little effort they want to put in goes to zero.

This is what people do because the tutorials are useless. Thick accents and just bad at explaining concepts. Most people go to a university to get the paper. I cant just dont go to uni and then self learn everything since HR would pass on me over someone with a degree. 

> We straight up have professors from Tsinghua, Stanford, Cambridge, UPenn, etc, with vast and extremely technical knowledge, profs who work to design major parts of internet infrastructure, etc. 

So? If I want I can visit them during office hour or during tutorials and lectures. I have that **choice**. 

>  There's the other side trying to push NTU to become a greater school in every meaning of the word.

And you do this by improving the teaching significantly. Merely forcing people to attend subpar classes and spending that additional 2 hour traveling time will not improve the learning experience at all.

> between a piece of paper and what an NTU education stands

The difference is NTU has a stronger brand than a private uni because of the research that it does and the alumni network that comes with it. Not because of the teaching. There are private unis with way better teaching but having an NTU cert is more valuable than some unrecognised private university.

No, it is not because I am against religion, it is simply because they are annoying beings. To my Christian friends, I guess many of you would also agree that lay preachers disturbing and stalking people irresponsibly all over the campus are not good for the image of you Christians (well, provided that you are from denominational churches…). I am not against religious CCA groups either, as long as you are not disturbing lives of your fellow schoolmates. The plain fact of the matter is that public preaching is a disturbance, and is straightaway evil when students who have little experience dealing with these irrational people become targets. I came swords with one this May, when he kept blocking the way of a confused PRC student. I stopped him, and he followed me all the way from North Spine to South Spine! But at least I managed to get him to a less populous place. Now you again may say, ‘But hey, free religion!’ Yes, but freedom in practice means not interfering the freedom of others. Moreover, most denominational churches (Catholic, Lutheran, Calvinist, English Anglican…) do not practice street preaching, and it’s only those churches who call themselves non-denominational (mostly linked to the two Awakenings) that are the most passionate, and they are really impossible to be differentiated from cults appearing to be Christian at first glance (because the latter ones are evolved from the former ones), and when you really can differentiate them, you have already gotten in there enough. 

Lastly, here is a tip: if you do come across a lay preacher, ask for their denomination, or what church they are affiliated to. That will scare off most of them without debating whether God exists.",148,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1f7z5gk/street_preaching_should_be_banned_in_ntu/,,,

For denominational churches you have the Holy Communion and masses together, but they don’t seem to care about them. Also, when I ask what their denominations are, they mostly just reply ‘I do not have a denomination, I just believe in Jesus blah blah blah’, and when I ask them again, they just say ‘Jesus bless you’ and run away.

Do agree with you there are some churches that are very much only interested in evangelising people, because more people converts to more money to the church.

,Post,1fm0frb,A rant on ACC and NACC Presidents,EverySink,2024-09-21 11:00:05+00:00,"NTUSU Executive Committee has faced widespread criticism for corruption. However, there is one group who received very few critisms despite being instrumental towards said corruption—the presidents of academic constituent clubs (ACCs) and the presidents and vice presidents of non-academic constituent clubs (NACCs). 

For those who don’t know, ACCs consist of our school-based clubs, such as NBS, CCDS, and EEE. NACCs consists of SC, CAC, and WSC. The legislative branch of NTUSU is vested in NTUSU Council, which is made up of presidents of ACCs and NACCs and vice-presidents for NACCs. They are responsible for electing the NTUSU executive committee and determining which policies the executive committee should implement or reject.

Last year, our ACC and NACC presidents voted against publishing the Union Budget line-by-line, effectively denying us transparency regarding how our union fees are spent! This year, they voted in an establishment candidate as NTUSU president while rejecting a candidate who advocated for budget transparency, electoral reform, and checks and balances—thus further entrenching nepotism within NTUSU!

It is very clear that the ACC and NACC presidents cannot be trusted to represent the interests of their students. NTUSU Executive Committee election should be opened to all 20000+ students to vote, rather than being restricted to the votes of just 20+ members of the NTUSU Council!",139,2,https://i.redd.it/n2bhieg395qd1.jpeg,,,

Is it supposed to be everyone who is against and anti-estab must be voted in - else u call it nepotism and corruption?

Also, I think the school you go to might matter. I'm not very sure about STEM courses, but humanities/social sciences is a very liberal sort of school?

What mindset are you talking about? OP hasn't said anything about their race. And if their lived experience as a black person has caused them to navigate the world in a certain way, why is it their fault? In some parts of the world, being conscious of your own blackness is a quite literally a matter of life or death.

Look up the concept of ""double consciousness""; this is by no means newfangled ""woke"" nonsense. If anything it's old hat by now.

>never use the word ""black"" again

Why not? It's just a descriptor. Racial categories might not map 1:1 from Western contexts to Singapore, but people here use ""black"" as often as they do ""African"" or ""African-(insert nationality here)"".

Not sure if it’s due to me being in an engineering course. Being in final year, I’m worried that if I still don’t date, I’ll likely be single for life. Is this usually the case?

,Comment,1fb5shb,Dating,Love__urself,2024-09-07 15:34:26+00:00,"I‘ll present an unpopular opinion instead. 

People said uni is one of the best times to date in ur life, people said by 30 u should aim to achieve a milestone of having 100k in savings, people in the past said u should aim to have 5Cs by a certain age, but why are there ’shoulds‘ and ’should nots‘ in life in the first place? Why are we living to other ppl’s timelines? Why are there timelines in the first place?

I came across a saying recently, ”Timeline should only be followed on an individual level.“, and I personally find that to be true. Colonel Sanders succeeded in his endeavors (I didn‘t even phrase it as succeeding in life, because success’s all arbitrary and subjective, success could mean different things to different ppl), I‘m sure u can find many ppl who’ve succeeded late (in their endeavours) in life too as well. 

People rush into dating, break up later, have to ‘restart’, feel rushed again and the whole cycle repeats. People rush into marriage, and then divorce later as well. 

Life‘s meant to be experienced, who are rushing us anyway? If it’s societal pressure, take some time to yourself to think more deeply and look past that. 
I‘ve an acquaintance who cited the same reason as u, being in the final year of studies and afraid of being alone for the rest of his/ her life, the person ended up jumping on any opp. sex that he/ she came across. 
Do u really want to end up in this way though?

,Comment,1fb5shb,Dating,Sill_Dill,2024-09-08 01:43:08+00:00,"Uni is indeed one of the best time to expand your social circle. Not so much to date. Your school work takes precedence and girls won't want to jeopardize that by getting romantically involved.


I suggest, don't 'date'. Make friends, expand your social network and make your advance after you start work. Use this duration to learn more about her and let her know more about you. 


You don't have to 'confess' 
confessions are for idiots who can't read between the lines. If she feels comfortable enough with you, she will move into the next stage with you exclusively without saying anything. Like agreeing to go with you to an overseas trip in which you pay for air tickets and hotel. Discuss with her on the choice of hotel first and show her one room with a twin bed before going for the tickets. You don't have to go far. A motorcycle road trip in Chiang mai or Bali will suffice. If you want to push further, going to Australia is another good option. If you can't ride or drive because you don't have a licence, I suggest you go take the licence first.

One way is to sit a seat away from a girl you find interesting and likely single, act blur about CA/assignment and ask her about where to find the rubrics or date (especially if it’s some CC mod with multiple course sites). 

Next lesson, find common topic again, add in a few compliment and see her reaction, if she is comfortable, then proceed to slowly add each other on Instagram or LinkedIn. If you feel even a slight distancing or discomfort, then you likely missed the shot.

Shooting the shot needs us to take hints well. Progress as friends first to know each other well before making it obvious. A suggestion is to be comfortable to make platonic opposite gender friends, that takes time to learn.",9,0,,,,llz7epp

,Comment,1f9e2r1,Yet another lonely guy here,CloudlessEveningSky,2024-09-05 04:51:50+00:00,"Reading about your situation, my opinion is you should stop thinking about joining so many activities or finding friends. You need to fix the fundamental root causes of the problems first. 

Work on your own personal image, learn how to interact well with people, as in learn how to give other people a good / fun / interesting time when talking to them. Maybe you can watch more Netflix shows to have more common conversation topics, and also observe how actors talk. 

Learn how to have tact, like for instance when ur roomie rejects you, learn to accept it graciously as a man and figure out how you can keep making yourself better so someone will not reject you in future. Don’t keep pestering and inviting him if he already refused. 

I think if you keep working on your own image, people will come into your life eventually, all the best.",79,0,,,,lll09ab

If you have social anxiety, maybe look at the way you interact with people or present yourself, or maybe you missed some social cues? I can only say so much because everyone is different. Don't push too much, don't think too negatively. You'll be surprised at how easy it is to make friends, granted I'm not in uni yet even.

I made some of my closest friends from saying random shit, one of them was when I turned to him and said I feel like dying during sit n reach for pe. A girl I was really close with was by telling her her football shirt is shit.

If u want a club with low commitment while being able to make friends, join gem club, like before the start of each semester there’s a campus tour program where u r supposed to bring the exchange students around NTU and do some activities to earn points which at the same time u can bond with them, I went for 2 so far, one in my Y1S2 and one just this sem. 

My experience is pretty positive as I am able to click well with the exchange students and make friends with them while also increasing my confidence at meeting new people which helps a lot given I’m quite introverted.

Let’s just share my experience with gem for this sem, after the campus tour events I click pretty well with these 2 girls from Finland and Sweden(my assigned group was like 80% Europeans, only 2 is from Australia and US each), we met a couple of times since first week of school started 1 is a dinner in school and a second one is a hangout outside school during Saturday, then 
 just yesterday I had lunch with the Finnish girl for like catchup after my lab session. The ones I met this sem is the best as compared to previous 2 semesters in terms of how we click mutually ah.

Although I plan to join some trivial event in the middle of the school under gem but didn’t go due to lack of time but at the same time I also feel with the people I click well with I feel is enough atleast for this sem without stretching myself too much.

As for class perhaps just sit beside someone and ask lecture related stuff or something which is kinda what I did for my class, tho we ain’t like super close to the point like we eat consistently together but they are friendly enough to talk abit which of course pave way for future collaboration in group work and etc.",4,0,,,,lll56e3

I met my first few people in first semester studying with them in a regular basis, but they were not the kind of people I wanted to hang out with, there was no bond other than “we need to get ready for exams, do you have the copies?”, another group organised a house party and I joined, they didn’t want me in first, in fact, they thought I was avoiding them, I told them i wasnt, i was just too shy sonthey gave me the address and time. Party went well and I got massively drunk with the rest and we all got to know each other well, then I found out one of them was selling ripped cds and happened to have all of the obscure artists i wanted to hear and he had high speed internet so I just used to crash at his place just to be able to listen to good music and browse at good speeds.. 22 years after we are still good friends. I don’t know, I guess alcohol helped me a lot, it is probably the worst advice you will get but, I really bonded with other people through alcohol and exposure because i used to be really bad at sports, out of shape and really stupid with girls 🤷. I met a few people like you, and honestly it seemed to me they were putting an effort on being alone and keeping themselves away from everybody, just like the initial group though I was avoiding them and they didn’t like me because of it.

Like having the ability to talk about global news, finance, exercising, studies, travel, to anime, gaming, TV shows.

Its messed up and the uni doesn't even acknowledge it.The buses are so infrequent that it feels like you have to plan your entire day around their unreliable schedule. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve to walk that it feels like they don't even exist.With the midterms in line, I don't think bus is truly an option. At this point just add a new fees on top of the already existing fees which we pay coz I guess that's what matters the most to NTU. 
And when the buses do finally show up, they often come in clumps—one after another—making it completely pointless. You end up waiting for what seems like forever, only for three buses to roll in simultaneously, creating chaos and congestion. It’s clear that there’s no coherent planning or efficient scheduling behind it. Why is it so difficult to have a reliable, consistent bus service that actually meets the needs of the students.

Esp during peak hours embarking and disembarking can take 2-3 minutes. The first bus picks up all the load so subsequent ones are a lot faster. You could do very self defeating things like making buses stop when the one ahead stops.

And you're isolated from the cost but buses are not cheap. At surge pricing it's \~110/hr. At 2 hours in a peak hour, two peak hours a day, two buses more per route on both main routes, every weekday for half the year, is 230k a year.

It's not consistent because student schedules are extremely inconsistent.

The period of suspension is two weeks from Sept 10 to 23.

The licensee has accumulated 12 demerit points within a 12-month period and was fined a total of $800 for selling food that contained ""matter foreign to the nature of such food"" and failing to keep its premises free of infestation.

Based on track records, a licensee who accumulates 12 or more demerit points during a 12-month period may have his licence suspended for a period of either two or four weeks or cancelled.

All food handlers working in the suspended premises would also be required to re-attend and pass the WSQ Food Safety Course Level 1, before they can resume work as food handlers.

The licensee is also required to ensure that all food hygiene officers working in the suspended premises, if any, re-attend and pass the Workforce Skills Qualifications Food Safety Course Level 3.

SFA also advises members of the public who come across poor food safety practices in food establishments not to patronise such outlets and provide feedback via the online feedback form at www.sfa.gov.sg/feedback or to call SFA Contact Centre at 6805-2871 with details for our follow-up investigations.",23,0,,,,lmkuxgn

Timeline: Singapore school term is Jan - Nov, and after your A level, you are wasting 10-month time before can get started. May other countries do AY from Sep-June, so no time wastage when it comes to admission into uni.

Rigid system: Level-skipping is highly restricted in Singapore, the odd is about 3 in 100k, meaning every cohort there is only 1 or 2. And one can't just take A-Level/IB as a private candidate if studying in the public schools. In other countries, level skipping and taking private A-level/IB is much easier, making many already eligible for uni at age of 16 or 17, or even younger.",3,0,,,,lplzq3x

Its just most singaporean places that sell indian food actually sell the 'southern indian style takes' of most dishes, which for biryani is usually a more tangy vibrant color spice style, (which is well appreciated too). And a lot of Singaporeans take those dishes as the 'classic cultural' cook. Which is why Northern Indian dishes are a pleasant '....oh wow!' for those who have only had the more tangy biryani, or rasam, or dosa, or certain types of daal, or whatnot.

No problem! The T-84 is a Ukrainian battle tank based on the soviet T-80, specifically the iteration T-80UD. The T-84 was first introduced in 1976 and entered service in 1999.

Equipped with a 6TD-2E 6-cylinder turbocharged liquid cooled engine, the T-84 has a maximum speed of 70km/h and if fuel tanks are added, a maximum travelling distance of 500km. Additionally, such a powerful engine gives the T-84 an amazing power-to-weight ratio of 26 horsepower/tonne.

The T-84 main armament is smoothbore 125mm KBA-3 cannon capable of firing HEAT, HE-FRAG, and APFSDS rounds as well as laser guided missiles. The cannon is fed by an auto loader, conveyor and control system, therefore eliminating the need for a manual loader. Other armaments include a KT-7.62 coaxial machine gun and at KT-12.7 anti-aircraft machine gun to defend the metallic beast against infantry and air units respectively. 

Moving on to the defensive stats of the T-84, the T-84 is equipped with duplet Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA), Zaslin Active Protection System, Varta optronic countermeasures system and other tank protection systems. Particularly, the ERA serves to protect the tank from anti-tank grenades, anti-tank missiles and HEAT projectiles. 

The T-84 is currently serving the Ukrainian army in the Russian invasion of Ukraine and is believed to have been deployed by the 14th Mechandized Brigade during the battle in Donbas.",6,0,,,,lnv8kua

,Post,1fm9xnw,Reform the clubs!,BillRevolutionary990,2024-09-21 18:46:48+00:00,"tl;dr [sign this petition for reforms that fight back against NTUSU shenanigans, get rid of do-nothing clubs and create a culture where good people are encouraged to create great clubs](https://forms.gle/Ag7oB76MwxkCmjKG6) (which I will be forwarding to the SAO to demand reforms).

The NTU Students' Union (NTUSU) are plagued with a series of concerning issues, including allegations of racism, attempted drugging (vodka incident), incompetence, reports of candidate manipulation, and opaque financial and political processes. The wider club scene also has problems like limited participation and being ""do-nothing"" clubs. The root cause of these issues lies in a system that discourages good, capable individuals from taking on leadership roles and, for those who do, makes it difficult to perform effectively. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle of dysfunction. There are three fundamental, systemic reasons why the current system doesn't work:

1. **Barriers to Leadership for Good People**:
   * Talented and well-intentioned individuals face significant obstacles in entering leadership positions. Clubs with elected leaders often operate under obscure and hidden processes, including secretive deconflict lists, inaccessible whistleblowing systems, opaque nomination procedures, and indirect voting mechanisms. Special interest clubs, which do not allow for democratic voting, are governed by nepotism, where the outgoing executive committee handpicks the next. While some smaller clubs may function adequately, the majority see leadership roles filled by individuals more concerned with social climbing than contributing to the club’s success. These are often those who engage in brown nosing, political networking, and sometimes, manipulation.
2. **Running a Club is Time-Consuming and Penalizes Good Leadership**:
   * Successfully managing a club requires considerable time and energy, often at the expense of a student's academic performance, internships, and projects. The only current benefit - hall points - are typically monopolized by those described in the previous point, leaving dedicated individuals with little to show for their efforts.
3. **Lack of Accountability and Feedback Mechanisms**:
   * Student organizations, including NTUSU and academic constituent clubs, are frequently perceived as ""useless"". There are no structured feedback mechanisms, and leaders have no reliable means of understanding student needs or how many support particular initiatives. Consequently, a good leader has no systematic way to gather feedback and address issues effectively, while a poor leader can ignore even widespread concerns without repercussions.

This environment dissuades capable students from stepping into leadership positions, as they recognize that their efforts are likely to be diluted and their potential impact minimized. Even in special interest clubs, students are discouraged from starting new clubs, as the Student Affairs Office (SAO) enforces strict prohibitions on creating clubs with similar purposes, granting existing clubs (and their handpicked exco successors) a perpetual monopoly over certain areas. But how can we change it?

# Proposed Reforms:

1. **Reform Voting Procedures in Privileged Clubs**: Certain clubs are meant to directly serve the student body (compared to pursuing and interest) and have privileged access to the administration. By their nature there can only be one such club. These are clubs like NTUSU or Academic Constituent Clubs. Such clubs which enjoy extraordinary privilege and influence, they must be held directly accountable to the students they serve.
   * **Direct Elections**: The current system of indirect voting, particularly within NTUSU, must be replaced with direct voting. The current structure, in which representatives—who collectively represent only a small fraction of the 20,000+ students—select leaders, is ridiculous. Furthermore, an ""Against"" option should be included on ballots to give students the ability to reject unsuitable candidates and trigger new elections.
   * **Transparency**: All documentation related to leadership elections, including candidate nominations, reasons for disqualifying candidates, whistleblowing reports, and deconflict lists, must be made publicly accessible. Financial documents for clubs funded by student fees, such as NTUSU, must also be made transparent to ensure accountability.
   * **Addressing Student Issues**: Clubs that are based on serving students (such as NTUSU, Academic Constituent Clubs etc) should prioritize serving student needs. A clear, public list of student issues should be maintained, starting with those raised during elections and expanded based on popular demand. A weekly Outlook poll - replacing or included in the updates we already get from NTUSU - could be implemented to assess student satisfaction with ongoing initiatives and to gather new concerns. This simple feedback mechanism would require minimal resources to set up but would vastly improve responsiveness.
2. **Elevate the Role of Special Interest Clubs**: Special interest clubs should be valued as key platforms for imparting knowledge and fostering student achievement, not just ""side hobbies"". NTU’s current system lacks support for critical fields like AI, innovation, and student research. High performing students don't get any recognition, but do-nothing clubs are recognized by NTU. For example, the competitive programming group has won international competitions but is not recognized as a club. But the NTU Open Source Society - which has made zero contributions to open source software - receives hall points, funding, rooms, and so on.
   * **End Monopolies**: The SAO must allow the formation of multiple clubs with similar focuses, introducing a ""Tier 5"" system for new clubs. While the administration cannot provide unlimited resources (especially hall points and money), these Tier 5 clubs would have access to free, underutilized resources like empty tutorial rooms and lecture halls at low-priority booking slots. This system would encourage healthy competition, allowing new clubs to eventually overtake do-nothing ones based on merit.
   * **Achievement-Driven Rankings**: The current ranking system, based on membership size and minimal activity requirements, is inadequate. Clubs should be assessed based on their achievements, outputs, and contributions. For example, hobby clubs like the Visual Arts Society could be evaluated based on student feedback, while technical clubs like the Open Source Society could be ranked based on their success in competitions, or contributions to research and innovation. NTU must recognize the diversity of interests across its student body and evaluate clubs accordingly. Faculty sponsors with expertise in the club’s field should play a central role in guiding clubs toward meaningful achievement and should have their clubs success included in their KPIs.
3. **Provide Greater Support for Successful Club Leaders**:
   * Students who effectively run clubs or achieve significant success should be recognized and rewarded. NTU should allow leadership roles and significant student accomplishments to count as ""Special Activities"" BDEs, with grades reflecting their contributions. Managing a club or winning a major competition is no less educational than taking a BDE in photography. Additionally, NTU should proactively encourage high-achieving students to take on leadership/competitive roles. Currently, many talented students avoid club leadership due to the systemic challenges outlined above.

>NTU Students' Union (NTUSU) are plagued

Tars all student bodies with the same brush.


>root cause of these issues lies in a system that discourages good, capable individuals from taking on leadership roles and, for those who do, makes it difficult to perform effectively. This creates a self-reinforcing cycle of dysfunction

There are many clubs with a high level of participation from the student body, and there are many clubs with lesser participation.


> outgoing executive committee handpicks the next.

This has to do more with choosing leaders who have the knowledge and experience of having participated and worked in the club's committees, before they take on more senior leadership roles, especially the ""top 4"". Seriously, any freshie thinking they're ready to run for the ""top 4"" is deluded.


>The only current benefit - hall points

Argument fails in light of the numerous Non-constituent clubs, whose leaders and members receive limited benefits, if any at all.


>frequently perceived as ""useless"".

>no reliable means of understanding student needs or how many support particular initiatives

Hard to believe this. Are these student leaders not in the same academic environment? From their interaction and involvement in the club's activities, are they know exposes to the same issues? Perhaps OP is misguided in thinking student leaders have real power. No. Student government is really more like an enlightened ""class monitor"" or ""class rep"". They still need to work with the faculty and administration to get ANYTHING DONE.


>must be replaced with direct voting. 

Demonstrates just how inexperienced OP is. All the ""work"" are done by subcommittee members. Why would any of the subcommittee members work for/with leaders they didn't support for in the leadership race? In fact, many sub committee members join such committees because they identify with the drive and vision of individual student leaders. A populist who the ""working members"" don't identify will be ineffective and just cause more damage.


>Successfully managing a club requires considerable time and energy, often at the expense of a student's academic performance, internships, and projects

Hello, this is student leadership, you're not actually a real CEO or President of some corporate. First, don't expect any rewards. If you run for office, it's in service of the club and it's members. Secondly, if you can barely handle your academic obligations, you have no business running for student leadership positions. You're in NTU to get a degree first, not to be president of some club people will not remember even 1 year after you've graduated.


>SAO must allow the formation of multiple clubs

There's already a mechanism for forming new student clubs. How else did you think all these clubs formed in the first place? Every Non-constituent club was started by students, from scratch, with little or no support to begin with.


>achievements, outputs, and contributions

And who will decide whether ""environmental and sustainable"" goals are less or more valued than say, ""bringing financial literacy"" to the student population ? Participation level is a good universal metric. If your club has a bigger footprint in terms of appeal and impact, it will show for itself in terms of the number of sub committee members they can attract to volunteer their time, and subsequently with the number of participants they can involve in their activities.


>Students who effectively run clubs or achieve significant success should be recognized and rewarded

Thousands of student leaders in the past have had no need for such rewards. If you asked many of them, they did it out of a sense of duty or service. Their rewards were lifelong friendships, experience from learning to work with others, and a real-world understanding of how to actually ""get things done"".

,Comment,1fm9xnw,Reform the clubs!,BillRevolutionary990,2024-09-22 02:37:59+00:00,"1) I specifically separated the list of concerns about NTUSU from the wider club scene. But both are clubs are work within the same system.  
  
2) On average, what I and other students see is low participation and activities. I can give you many specific examples - NTU does not run a CTF like SMU/SIT/NUS does (although some people are trying to fix this), the Open Source Society does zero contributions to open source, etc. While its true some clubs do better and some worse, the average is lower than many students want. This has a large part to do with systemic reasons. And while existing excos would (not unfairly) be miffed that they're expected to perform at a super high level, the monopoly given by SAO creates a bad system where the level they are performing at is the level the whole school performs at for that interest/focus, now and forever. 

3) It may or may not have to do with knowledge/performance. The situation is better in smaller clubs, but larger clubs are extremely susceptible to brown nosers. If you're making the claim that all NTU excos are chosen because they are knowledgeable/competent, we are not going to believe you. Anyone ever who has been involved with clubs has stories of brown nosers/less competent people getting higher level roles because of connections. 

4) Yes for shortness I left out how certain clubs don't receive hall points. And I don't understand what you mean by the argument fails, I am arguing for an expansion of the benefits.

5) I don't mean in the specific sense of getting resources from the school, or things that rely on admin. I mean useless compared to the purpose of each club. And this often has to do with how they were chosen. I don't think most excos are bad people, its just that they have many reasons - both from selection to when they are running - to perform.

6) To be clear, I am for direct voting in specifically clubs that are supposed to serve students and derive extraordinary privileges from these. These are clubs that are supposed to represent students, like NTUSU. I do not mean clubs like the Sailing club. I can turn your later argument to you and say these members should be motivated by purpose etc to serve on subcommittees. The question of getting students to serve is much better handled with feedback and evaluation, instead of creating this system of hidden political processes which protects insiders and lets people like the previous SU president come to power while making it very hard to get her out.

7) I completely disagree with the crab bucket/let them eat cake mentality where you say excos should be able to both handle academics and their roles. It's a false dichotomy where someone is either ""good"" and can handle it no issue, or ""bad"" and can't. The fact is no matter how good you are, by spending the time needed to be on the exco, you suffer in what you could have done with that time otherwise. And because things were done like this in the past, or ""always done this way"", it shouldn't change. Rewarding good people should be the norm, not the exception.

8) I think you should read the part after ""SAO must allow the formation of multiple clubs"" which is ""with similar focuses"". If you didn't know, SAO completely prohibits this right now. Combined with the system of handpicking successors, this creates a system where good people who are passionate can't form their own club if one already exists, they must try to climb to the exco in another club and hope its not already taken over by brown nosers. 

9) There are many possible mechanisms, the final system in place would rely on having both long term stakeholders (essentially professors in the school, possibly Deans as well) who want the student body to develop in a certain direction, and student input on which clubs they find valuable. Participation is an extremely anti-achievement metric. Achievements are almost universally made by small groups of people. In the current system if I get fifteen people to come to a movie watching in the film society, but the competitive programming club (if it existed) got five people to win an international level competition, on paper I am three times more successful than them, which is ridiculous. Participation completely ignores vast kinds of talents and skills based achievement the school needs. 

10) This is similar to the crab bucket mentality mentioned above. While past exco members might feel annoyed that they weren't treated better, this is not a reason to keep the system from improving. They will gain all those things you mentioned and more.",-3,0,,,,lob191t

Very anecdotal. ""Where's the data?"" Even if a school has 1,000 students, how many are free enough to join certain activities? It's a university so many people have other priorities. Not wanting to participate is a legitimate right and choice. So then, you would have to compare participation with similar events held by other student bodies, before you can even argue that 30 or 50 or 100 people attending is ""low"".


>larger clubs are extremely susceptible to brown nosers. If you're making the claim that all NTU excos are chosen because they are knowledgeable/competent, we are not going to believe you. 

""Sucking up"" doesn't always work, but it's definitely unavoidable. No one is going to give you time of day, if you're such a jerk, unless you can get things done. And if you can get things done, you know you can get more things done with a fake smile than with open confrontation. Also, I referred to the Top 4. Everyone else is learning. The Top 4 are learning too, but they should be leading more.


>I am arguing for an expansion of the benefits.

Many of the student-initiated clubs were started out of interest and passion. They were not there to ""farm benefits"" like points or privileges. This is not some secondary school or junior college where you get points for CCA. 


>direct voting in specifically clubs that are supposed to serve students and derive extraordinary privileges from these.

You can already do that. Run for your school's Uniom Rep or Academic School Club committee. If you're too fresh and inexperienced, join a sub committee or support the campaign of a candidate you identify with. Go and vote, and encourage others to vote. You'll learn you encounter the first challenge of democracy as experienced in the west: voter apathy. So we know that, at least, those who manage to get voted in, succeeded in mobilising enough people and maybe they can get some things done. If a candidate is truly ""rubbish"", it would be easy to challenge them. Then the only question remains, is it the SAO's fault or the Faculty's fault if better candidates don't want to step up?


>The fact is no matter how good you are, by spending the time needed to be on the exco, you suffer in what you could have done with that time otherwise

Rubbish. Thousands and thousands of student leaders have been able to find a balance. Yes, it's a balance. Yes, it's a trade off. Student leadership has nothing to do with reward. If there are any privileges, they usually don't match the time and effort that was invested.


>""SAO must allow the formation of multiple clubs"" which is ""with similar focuses"".

Maybe you should understand why they disallow it. Perhaps it could be because in the past, people have tried to game the system to create new clubs for the sake of it, just so they can ""farm points and privileges"". That's just one reason.


>In the current system if I get fifteen people to come to a movie watching in the film society, but the competitive programming club (if it existed) got five people to win an international level competition, on paper I am three times more successful than them, which is ridiculous.

You just proved the absurdness of your perspective. An activity that benefits 15 students is definitely 3 times more effective than one that only benefits 5 people. This particular comparison is silly too. It takes a lot more effort to organize a film screening that has a wide enough appeal, at a time and place that would encourage attendance. The 5 people can just sign up for the competition without the need to even form a club at all.


>similar to the crab bucket mentality mentioned above.

Saying this demonstrates that you both don't understand the right application  of the metaphor and that you're still misguided with respect to student leadership.


I'm not going to participate in further responses. You have demonstrated in 10 points X 2, that you lack knowledge and experience with these matters. Your ""crusade"" is too generalised.


Pick an issue. One issue, but any other issue than this because you're clearly lacking on this one. Shuttle buses - why can't NTU have more/all standing style buses like NUS who had such buses more than 10 years ago? Canteen stalls - why must NTU keep giving operating licenses to Food Court Operators who will charge stall operators more and pass the higher costs to students, compare to NUS where they don't use food court operators ? Deal with the table hogging in libraries or improved access to facilities/amenities outside of school hours. Increased finance support for low/middle income students and foreigners for exchange programmes.

I've seen change, they often materialise over the period of 1/2/3 years, or more. They rarely start with petitions.


I'll give an example. Once upon a time, FOC organizers were allowed to have applicants submit their photos. These were then used by organizers to choose their freshies based on ethnicity and appearance. It was a long standing practice, that through the efforts of some individuals, came to an abrupt end. Those efforts didn't include a petition. They involved collecting actual evidence of which clubs engaged in such practices, how they did it, proof of bona fide applicants who should have qualified but were rejected. And then, putting it all together and having genuine student leaders directly petition the administration for a response and action. That's student leadership.

The fundamentals of what I say (indirect voting in NTUSU, excos picking the next generation, the monopoly enforced by SAO, competition winning students often not coming from clubs, etc) are well known (I'd be surprised if you didn't know them). The generalisation appears because when the scope of your argument increases, it does become more general. And the purpose of this is to affect the entire club scene, instead of going after small but specific instances of things going wrong. Yes, like your FOC example I could be very small and specific. I could send an angry letter showing the GitHub for the Open Source Society hasn't made any commits in the past few years. I could send an angry letter about how the winners in one of the ICPC International Collegiate Programming Contests from NTU don't even have a club. But this would not address the common root cause which keeps and will continue to keep creating new examples of these. What I want to do is change the system so these will not happen intrinsically. 

Well, it's less lazy than doing nothing. It has been my experience in the school that if you want to make a systemic change, it starts with showing people want it. Specific, small examples of things going wrong like your FOC example doesn't, but making systemic changes doesn't work with collecting small examples. If the school isn't even willing to read the petition and respond, I doubt another hundred pages of screenshots of clubs doing nothing, or award winning students not developing their interests of a club, etc will make them.

But at least you have a job unlike the other graduates who are still banging on companies' doors hoping that somebody is willing to take them in.  My friend and I graduated this June, but he's still job-hunting as of date; he's gotten several rejections and ghostings and not even a single offer.  He mostly spends his days now job-hunting while just chilling at home.

And yeah - like what everybody else has said here, forget what other people think (i.e., there will always be naysayers); take a moment to count your blessings and be grateful that you've an office to go to, money to receive at the end of each month, benefits to use, and like what you said - a chance to grow to where you want to be!

>people are surprised to know that i've joined the company i'm in, asking me not to settle too

Yeah, well - people can judge you for all sorts of reasons; I bet you could probably shit the wrong way and somebody would think of you as ""uncivilized"".  Just do what you think is best for yourself at the end of the day!

I once shared my salary to some people - including my juniors - and some of them were like: ""so little?""  Look - I'm sorry that my salary isn't enough; maybe they have a HDB loan to pay off or a massive installment on a Lamborghini to cough up by the end of the month - hence why they think that my salary is so little?  Plus, ""high paying"" and ""entry-level jobs"" don't exactly go together (unless you're working in tech. or are lucky); if the pay is so bad to you, well then I don't know - maybe try looking for better-paying, more senior positions instead of entry level ones?",2,0,,,,lmapop9

,Post,1fhd74g,Open NTUSU Excecutive Committee election to all students for voting,EverySink,2024-09-15 14:01:31+00:00,"For those who don’t know, there are two branches of NTUSU: Legislative Branch and Executive Branch. 

Legistrative power of NTUSU is vested in NTUSU Council, which consists of:
- Presidents of Academic Constituent Clubs (E.g. ADM club, CCEB club, EEE club, etc)
- Presidents and Vice-Presidents/Honorary General Secretaries of Non-Academic Constituent Clubs (Cultural Activities Club, Sports Club, Welfare Service Club)

Each Academic Constituent Club is given 1 seat taken up by their President, and each Non-Academic Constituent Club is given 2 seats taken up by their Presidents and Vice-Presidents/Honorary General Secretaries.

Executive power of NTUSU is vested in NTUSU Executive Committee (or NTUSU Exco in short). They are made up of Union Executive Committee Representatives (or Union Reps in short) from various Academic and Non-Academic Constituent Clubs.

Various positions for NTUSU Exco will be elected by NTUSU Council during their 1st Annual General Meeting.

**This process is inherently unfair.**

Different academic clubs have different number of students. For example, Accountancy and Business Club has around 3796 students while NIE Student Teachers’ Club only has around 599 students. Despite this, both clubs are given 1 seat in NTUSU Council, which means both clubs have equal powers when electing NTUSU Exco. This means that one NIE student has more voting power than one NBS student. Thus, current voting process is unfair to students belonging to large clubs. 

Moreover, how can we expect one or two individuals to effectively represent voices of hundreds or even thousands of their club members?

Therefore, NTUSU Exco election should be open to all of us to vote, just like how we voted for our Contituent Clubs’ Management Committee on 13th September during Union Day. 

Let’s also not forget that last year, another Union Rep also wanted to contest for President but he could only do so if Annabel's bid failed as he puts his name out slightly later than Annabel. This would not have happened if NTUSU Exco election were to be like Union Day elections.

Let our Union Reps campaign to over 20000 students in NTU as to why they are worthy of being in NTUSU Exco, instead of just campaigning to 20+ people in NTUSU Council. By doing so, it ensures that every NTU student's voice is heard and equally represented.",69,23,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fhd74g/open_ntusu_excecutive_committee_election_to_all/,,,

Pakistan, Nigeria, Brazil, and Bangladesh, would share 1 member.

They wouldn't need to.

They would just need to secure as close to 50 while ensuring their closest most credible competition is ranked dead last by their club. As such, the bigger clubs have an inherent advantage.

For most voters, the truth is they won't know all the candidates. You'll find that most would just want to vote for their favourite candidate and would be open to voting in any order the rest. As such, it's easier for the club to encourage them to vote one candidate last.",1,0,,,,lndadyl

Next is how they pronounce Chinese words, it's not easy to describe but PRC's Mandarin sounds more aggressive and powerful while Taiwanese is more gentle and softer

Also, I feel like most PRC students still use Chinese social media (Douyin, Weibo, QQ, Xiaohongshu, Wechat/Weixin, Bilibili and etc) even in Singapore, and they much less use the social media popular in Singapore or the ""English world"" (Facebook, Instagram,  WhatsApp, Reddit, YouTube, Discord, Twitch, LinkedIn and etc). 

Also one reason is that social media in Taiwan are quite similar to those in Singapore, except that Taiwan uses more of FB/Line, PTT/Dcard (Forum) and 104 (job hunting), and Singapore uses more of WhatsApp, Telegram, Reddit and LinkedIn.

Well, I am personally more open to everything and use all the above lah. I am trying to know more about the NTU community and the Singapore environment in different views.

I would bet that very very rare PRC students use Reddit.

They messed up. 
This is how simple that is.

However the way they messed up isn't unique.
This is how most of the position with a lot of resources and no obligation (whether is extrinsic or intrinsic endue) unfold to be.

I have seen too many cases of people lose control after bring granted something that they don't have before. Whether it is power to order other, money, or even simple as freedom to do something. And root cause of it is that we could not control something if we don't fully understand it. In my culture background, there is an idioms which translates to English is meant ""Get carried away"", which perfectly conclude when i try to express.

I think it is an inskipable quest for all average individuals. Not trying to justify their action by saying they are just immature, but saying it is good chance to see whether oneself in mature enough.
It is good to think about whether you might do the same action, if you are in exact condition as them. 

The Annabelle and friends, I have never met you or know you before, the only way I knew you is through all the trends describing. As an outlander, I would suggest to cool yourself down, don't worry too much of how that would impact reputation in the future. Knowing how to deal with downroad is also a good quality.

For the rest NTU fellows, if you are really unsatisfied with the current status. It is good chance to think about how you as individuals can prevent next average person doing same thing if given same position.

Not saying [the old one](https://wis.ntu.edu.sg/webexe88/owa/srce_smain_s.SRC_GenEntry?p_closewind=N) is perfect, but it is way better than whatever crap the new one is!

For one, the interface is so confusing! Everything is buried under multiple tabs and weird drop-down menus. Just finding a venue and time slot to book is such a headache!

On top of that, the website is painfully slow! Pages take forever to load, and half the time they just freeze up. I had to refresh multiple times just to get through a single booking! 

You expect a university with 'Technological' in its name to be proficient at technological stuff, but nope! NTU might as well stand for Not Technological University 😡",59,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fey03u/new_src_booking_system_sucks/,,,

,Post,1f6ul56,hall ac app down and there's sucharge?,MikealaV,2024-09-02 01:21:33+00:00,"hi guys, this morning when I woke up at 7:30-ish I tried to switch off my hall ac but the app kept telling me it had trouble connecting to the server and that the AC was offline. I thought maybe it was the WiFi connection so I tried both hall WiFi and my own data. I tried for maybe 10 minutes straight before giving up trying to turn it off. 

I've still been in my room (awake since 7:30) and you can hear when the AC turns off. At 9:09, a few minutes ago it just shut off on its own. When I went to open the app to check receipts it charged me with the full use of AC unti 9:09.

To my understanding the only time the AC should turn off on its own is at 11am just in case someone forgets about it and leaves it on right? So if it switches off at 9:09 on its own that means that they knew something was wrong w the AC?

OKOK TLDR AC app didn't work when I wanted to turn my ac off at 7:30. it turned off on its own at 9:09. It charged me use of AC until 9:09. can I do anything about this charge??",47,2,https://i.redd.it/1l44x56ksamd1.jpeg,,,

I joined ODAC but their activities are rather infrequent and as a result it’s hard to sustain friendships. I like bouldering and have been in NTU Sports Climbing Club since Year 2, usually go there about once every 1-2 weeks, but people there are always with their own social circles so it’s super hard to get into a convo with people and make friends, doesn’t help that bouldering is a very individualistic sport.

I'm three chapters behind in everything. I only show up to tutorials for attendance at this point. I’m in serious trouble and probably going to fail all my classes. I’m stuck staring at math proofs, vectors, and planes with no clue how people actually survive university. 

I came from poly and managed to exempt the intro computing module, but when it comes to math, it feels like the course just throws a new chapter at you every day and assumes you’ve got it. I’ve been Googling practice questions and watching videos, but the workload is so overwhelming that I forget everything the next day. It's like a daily cycle of confusion. Sometimes I wonder if I should have just gone for a non-STEM course.

Honestly, how do people survive uni? For those who’ve become entrepreneurs after going through it, do you feel like doing all these math proofs was a waste of time? I’m probably going to repeat this year or get kicked out of ntu.

Anyone else feel like they’re constantly forgetting everything they learn? Why not just give us more projects instead of these crazy math tests that only future researchers seem to care about?",42,20,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fi7uw3/ntu_poly_cs_mid_term/,,,

I recently got robbed while on an exchange program before school starts, and I'm trying to figure out my next steps. They took my cash and bank card, but I've already blocked my cards to prevent further issues. And lodging a police report. 

Has anyone here experienced something similar? I’m looking for any advice on how to 
handle the situation or what to do next. 

Specifically:

Has anyone dealt with being robbed while on exchange? What did you do, and how did it work out?

Does anyone know if I can claim compensation from Chubb insurance (the school's travel insurance)? If so, what’s the process like?

The claim process can be found here: [https://www.ntu.edu.sg/life-at-ntu/student-life/onestop/insurance-coverage/student-travel-insurance#Content\_C038\_Col00](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/life-at-ntu/student-life/onestop/insurance-coverage/student-travel-insurance#Content_C038_Col00) under Insurance Claims

Specifically in your given case: 

***7. What should I do if I lose my personal property, money, or travel documents?***

*You will need to file a report with the local police or the relevant authority within 24 hours of discovery. A written statement from the police or a report issued by the relevant authority evidencing the loss must be obtained to substantiate the claim.*

When filing your claim, just state the facts along with your police report. The claim dept will then follow up with you.

,Post,1f9kshl,Job Prospects for NTU EEE,hozy69,2024-09-05 12:06:43+00:00,"
I am firm in my decision to study EEE. During A-levels, I joined an undergraduate level robot making competition which made me completely fall in love with electronics and mechanics.

I decided to study in sg because it is affordable enough compared to UK/US top universities, and its not too bad either.

However, I've seen alot of negative comment on job prospects in sg in EEE especially for international student. Im from MY btw.

So my questions are:

1. Whats the job prospect for an international student in engineering field in singapore?

2. If I have done alot of personal projects in uni and high cgpa, how high is my chance to get a good internship and a good job in the field after i graduate?

I've been troubled by the uncertainties for months. Your reply will definitely be a great help to me.

If you have what it takes, EEE degree will definitely not be a hindrance to you. Super versatile and well regarded, just take a look at some high-achieving examples on LinkedIn. I’m personally transitioning to software so I cannot comment about electronics and mechanics, but there are always engineering jobs in Singapore. A lot of them are even taken up by foreigners because many Singaporeans do not want to work traditional engineering jobs anymore. But of course you will have to find an opening that can take in international workers like yourself…

,Comment,1fspwqd,fresh grad job search,Evening1231,2024-09-30 07:54:28+00:00,"Hey, same course but 2023 grad, I took a look at your resume in one of your older posts, it's likely that you need to improve the formatting of your resume.

It's unfortunate that you didn't get a response in the post, but I think you can do much better with the STAR method to help beef up each point. While it's a bit difficult, try to add some numbers to it too, if it's not measurable, try to ballpark it within reason. That's only a small part though, I think you can learn a lot from scrolling through resume subreddits to see what common improvements can be made.

If you're going for software dev roles, you likely need to showcase more aptitude in coding with latest technologies. More specifically, since you're oriented towards UI/UX you can consider getting some React projects going (best if you can showcase it easily). Remember that you need to stand out from thousands of candidates, you need to know something that most don't.

Edit: Consider running through some GPTs/LLMs, it's likely they know how to improve your points

E.g.

Old: Designed packaging boxes, product catalogues and posters.

New: Led the design of packaging boxes, product catalogs, and posters, resulting in a cohesive brand identity and improved customer engagement by XX% (Partially revised by LLMs)

*again, if you don't have XX%, you can ballpark. If I'm a recruiter, I'd not personally question 20%, but 200% can be a bit much.*",31,0,,,,lpmb558

Though interviewing itself is a huge mind game, you have to play cards that benefit you. Find a good balance to show both honesty and confidence, but never too much to get easily caught.

I assume you used Photoshop or Figma? Include the tool you used.
Showing how you used the tool in workplace is much better than listing the tools that you know how to use. 

To illustrate my points. For example, I had this line in my resume

>""Developed testing with GitLab CI/CD, catching up to 6 production bugs every sprint"".

1. I didn't catch 6 every sprint, probably 1 every now and then, but could they check? Likely not
2. This shows some cause and effect, which stands out that it did something, and prevented likely disaster. ""Developed testing with GitLab CI/CD"" just doesn't hit as hard.
3. I did however, do this CI/CD testing, so I do have the reciepts, but checking for the ""6"" number is hard.

,Post,1fl9czm,Thoughts on what’s next?,TeklCneo,2024-09-20 11:07:46+00:00,"Well I did see some comments and posts abt this topic, so here I go now:

In short I met this girl from one of my CCAs and frankly speaking, it’s going pretty well(at least in my POV). Recently started texting and like I’ve noted she does reply quite consistently(despite sometimes having a few hours gap presumably with our CAs nearby), plus we found out we’ve got quite alot in common, more than what i was expecting from someone who isn’t from my major( in fact within my major I’m quite left out 💀 and p much don’t click with that many people).

So then like after abit of thought, and yeah it’s damn early considering it’s been just a few weeks, I’d say i’ve begun catching some of that oxytocin-loaded emotions for her, and like pretty much as far as I’m able to notice by now my fam def will accept her, considering my fam circumstance being a little unusual esp with the siblings part which is where some of the similarities stem from. Plus like I do notice irl she does listen quite actively, and I’d say the conversation doesn’t feel forced.  She mentioned her fav food in passing so probably for her birthday or special day next year or so I’d probably cook it(+ for other friends as well), plus I guess my animals have done their part as well to help me out with this.

I did consult my closer friends(including attached ones) abt this, mentioning I should eventually slowly reveal to her the mental stuff that’s happened for me bit by bit(cos apparently sometimes it can be a dealbreaker in a dating sense, so better to find out first than later on), but I also want to see as an outsider what are y’all stance on what I should do next?  I also want to not come off as talking to her simply cos she’s a girl, but rather cos she’s a person I genuinely want to know better for who she is(like essentially wanting her to be part of my life, and yea before the comments come I do have a good bunch of guy friends as well).",31,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fl9czm/thoughts_on_whats_next/,,,

,Post,1fecazs,Huge rant...Jeez,ContributionFresh708,2024-09-11 15:01:51+00:00,"Hi all, I'm a freshman (y1s1) in CoE. I'm also taking a second major.  Honestly, I thought it was just me struggling and that i was the problem but I've come to realize that im not entirely the problem—my workload is bloody insane for a freshman and i do not think this path is worth my time. 

I regret choosing NTU and an engineering path. I couldve went for something more specific/niche that compliments my career goals instead of studying something generic and wasting time on useless mods. This semester, I’m juggling nine modules, including HW0001 [0AU] and it's overwhelming.

On top of that, I don't see any promising job prospects with my current degree. No, i am not in EEE. EEE is the best generic engineering degree and has great career prospects. So, respect to all those that made it through that path. Even if i was an EEE student, (im not) there are still alot of useless modules and i dont find it necessary at least for the type of job role i want to be in.

There are so many useless modules in CoE imo. I wont have enough time to work on personal projects or to build my resume if i were to aim for FCH in CoE. There is alot emphasis on theory and way less on practical skills in NTU. I know its not wrong for having such emphasis but it is just not for me and my interests/career goals do not align with all these modules. As much as how much we preach that we only learn more practical skills on the job, i believe we can keep pick up the theory too as we go on that career path.

Before i came to NTU, I was hoping to pick up relevant knowledge/Skills in Uni. I secured this offer before NS like every other guy. I know any engineering degree is versetile and all that but i have seen the real world a little too much. I do not need a degree with this level of versitility because i know what exactly i want to do 3-4 years down the road and know what exact sector i want to be in. I know how the job market is and how resumes/cover letters literally get screened/filtered out for full time jobs/internships. I wont even be able to secure a relevant internship just with the name of my degree and being a year 1 student in my mid 20s, its quite depressing and im feeling the fomo. 

I regret coming to NTU. I do not like the student life here, the culture, the work environment. Everything in NTU just feels so far away from reality and society. I also can’t stand the management. oh and im dying from the heat every day.

I guess its my fault for overlooking NTU's curriculum and setting high expections. i feel like this school focuses on their rank more than the welfare of their students.

Im just better off being in schools with a holistic and practical learning approach (it was nvr NTU lol). These ranks may mean something in overseas but they dont mean much in singapore and for me. 

If some random tomdickharry with a non-ivy US/AUS degree comes here working and drawing way more salary than a average proud FCH NTU/NUS student, we need to rethink our system here...

,Comment,1fecazs,Huge rant...Jeez,blooming_edelweiss,2024-09-11 16:48:14+00:00,"A few thoughts I had while reading your concerns:
1. If your workload is overwhelming, that’s normal. Yes, a double major probably doesn’t help, so reconsider that if you can (don’t know how undergrad works here and whether you can change it or not). However, uni should challenge you and get you out of your comfort zone. Set up a healthy learning schedule. I always used to study 6d a week and took one day off. See it as a job, get up early, take a lunch break and then work until 6-7pm and enjoy the evening without studying.
2. Won’t have time to work on projects: As far as I know you have many weeks off between semesters, use them. Not saying you shouldn’t take some time off, but if you just learn something a few days a week during semester break you should be able to do something.
3. Emphasis on theory and less on practical skills: This is a very big misunderstanding in my opinion. Uni is supposed to teach you how to think and solve problems. That’s what the theoretical mods are for. Why not learn more practical tools? The answer is easy, these tools are “easy”. If you learn to solve problems, you won’t struggle to pick up a new tool here and there. Also, these tools are easy to forget because most of it is just memorizing things. You’ll be paid to solve problems and not how some tool works. That’s why engineering jobs are generally well paid, because it isn’t easy to pick up problem solving skills, you cannot simply watch some online course.
4. Yes, the job market is depressing. We all would prefer to get an job that pays big bucks easily. Let’s hope it improves.
5. Regret coming to NTU: I don’t know NTU that well but I have been on campus a couple of times. Maybe check out other places to study. In my alma matter, I used to study in the library of another faculty of another uni. I know this is less possible here because the libraries of other unis are closed to outsiders, but maybe check out other faculty’s libraries. Maybe you feel more comfortable there.

In general, it might just be that you aren’t used to being challenged in that way. I also had similar feelings in my first semester of undergrad. I suggest that you fight through this semester and give your best. Then, you take some time during your semester break to consider whether to continue or not.
Did you end up having fun solving the exercises in at least some of your classes? Did you find out that the world is actually way more complex than you knew before and that fascinates you? Do you want to learn more from some of the brightest minds of our time? Do you want to learn more about things that other people found so fascinating that they dedicated their entire lifes to?
If you cannot answer any of these questions affirmatively, maybe it’s better to pursue something else. But I wouldn’t give up on the chance to study at NTU before at least trying. Many people envy you for the opportunity you have.",43,0,,,,lmmnytl

To answer OP, Cert is just to prove the employer that you can commit to something until it’s finished. Also to prove you have the basic knowledge about potential work that you will be doing. Cert ONLY gives an opportunity to get into a job with minimum pay. 

Even if you are the batch top, After getting into a company it all depends on your KPI and how good you are at the job. You will start to realize most of the things you studied in the degree are not being used in industry. Or sometime what you have studied is outdated. Or they use custom tools that are specific to company. 

So then you will be working under some Tomdickharry who has better KPI (who is better at doing the job) and learning from that person. But you never know maybe that Tomdickharry might not even have a cert or draws 10x salary than you. 

After few years, If you perform better you get higher salary increments or even start to get headhunted by other companies. You will likely to get promoted too. Maybe you could pass that Tomdickharry who doesn’t have a cert. On the other hand if your KPI is bad no cert can save you.. most likely other employees will hand over “easy” tasks. Drops you from meetings if there is no impact coming from you. Eventually forcing you to leave the company. Because company ONLY wants people who can get their work done.

For context, I am the president of NTU's Student Union (NTUSU) and I was fairly selected for the role after the previous president stepped down due to some personal issues. I believe that the student union will perform best if everyone inside knew each other and not waste time getting to know the other person so I hand-picked my friends and allowed their friends to join too(provided our vibes match). However, too many of our friends joined, hence the need to create new roles to support each other and assist the committee

We are also being judged for 'misusing the student funds. Every NTU student voluntarily donates to the union every academic year. The funds are used to support the students and host events for the student population. Since NTUSU is also made up of students, we have every right to use the funds to host our own bonding events and purchase supplies (Lat me tell you, alcohol is not getting cheaper with inflation).

Since we represent the students, the union helps them advertise by taking their ideas and passing them off as our own so that it looks more official, like the time we told everyone about the financial aid friends in NTU. Since we represent them anyway, there was no need to credit them for their work.

Now, everyone is getting angry for no reason because they do not agree with how I run my council due to some false online slander and lies, which we manage by reporting these untrue allegations and exposing their identities to show the world what cruel liars they are.

A cheaper alternative would be clippers barber, which costs around $20-25. There are also many cheaper gentlemen’s barbershops in residential areas (hdb blocks), but their clients are mostly locals and may not be familiar with non asian hair.

,Post,1fstagu,hawker culture in sg,Ok-Landscape-8305,2024-09-30 11:32:24+00:00,"I've never had a bad experience w food courts or hawkers until recently which was in ntu LOL I've come to realized that universities are really a miniature version of society that we have to start getting used to early

food courts r like the fundamentals of sg since it's so embedded in our culture, so it's kind of a representation of sg alr.. its not uncommon for hawkers at food courts anywhere to be raising prices and cutting portions to beat inflation, and I feel like the hawker culture in sg is all about the vibe that people experience by going there and having a meal. it's like the sincerity people used to have in making food for others and earning a living.. this might b common for most who tabaoed their food and are used to it but I'm q pissed off about the attitude some stalls have towards their customers.

as we all know drinks stalls are like the life of the entire food court, the food court isn't complete without a drink stall. and also drink stalls are the ones that make the most profit out of all the stalls in the food court (duh it's water and ice and syrup) 
so similar to any other stall in the food court, when inflation hits everyone raises their prices bc theyre making a loss to some extend.. I'm can't deny that drink stalls also make a loss (someone correct me if I'm wrong LOL) and it's definitely no normal to increase prices and reduce portions. in this case we usually see drink stall aunties putting more ice and less drinks to make up the same or lesser amount right?? like most stalls wouldnt take it for granted that their consumers are alright w the portion cut right but what I've experienced at a ntu food court was like an outright disrespect to the consumer (damn angry tbh)

I was queueing for a drink then I ordered then auntie would b preparing my drink right.. so this stall has a few aunties at the counter servicing customers and all.. so the one preparing my drink scooped a more than usual amount of ice (like 80% of the cup was already ice considering the amount of ice in the cup) then proceeded to fill the cup w the drink up to the 60% mark LOL THE DRINK WAS AT A LOWER LEVEL THAN THE ICE LOL

then the next auntie (w a little conscience) that she was supposed to pass the drink to and cap it saw it and laughed loudly, telling her that that was too much (太过分了) and to top it up a little more to cover the ice (which was still 3 cm below the cup line btw) at least. and this was all while I stood there watching the whole process and her turning to look at me after this charade and I was in utter disbelief not bc I was so shortchanged but bc I was treated like an idiot LOL 

like I fully understand that price inflation is unavoidable, portion cuts are a bit miserly of them altho that's not what they promoted as well LOL (they put 30oz on a poster they put up for that drink if I'm not wrong)
like if they didn't make a hooha while preparing it I would have just closed one eye even if they just gave me half a cup uk.. but the fact that their attitude was like a ""we r gonna cut portions, raise prices and laugh about it in your face bc there's nothing you can do about it since the drink stall runs this canteen"" kind of vibe.. that was lowkey shameless tbh... 

then imagine when tourists and international students come for their stay and experience this sort of poor service in the iconic hawker centre that people travel to SG just to experience.. like I'm sure this is not just my experience and some of y'all boomers r gonna b like y'all strawberries just suck it up it's life

,Post,1fbpdu7,Questions about hall allocation system,Consistent_Owl_3001,2024-09-08 04:15:50+00:00,"Hi everyone, I’m a first-year student, and I have a few questions about the hall allocation system:

1. Is hall accommodation still guaranteed for second-year students? I’ve seen mixed answers—some say yes, some say no—and I can’t find any official statement from NTU on this.

2. Is there an updated version of the Campus Life Involvement Annex A, with a complete list of all CCAs, roles, and their respective points? I’ve only found older versions, and I know the points get updated each year, but I can’t seem to find the most current one.

3. Is there a way to secure a single room or specific room types? For example, if you’re in JCRC, do you get priority for single rooms? I’m curious if there are any strategies that can increase my chances of getting a single room next year.

4. What does the hall application process look like for second-year students? Do we still rank our room type preferences, or do we get to choose the hall we want to stay in as well?

5. Lastly, if I have 5 CCA points but my CCA commitments are not hall-based (e.g., I’m involved in Student Union or WSC instead of hall councils or hall sports), does this mean I can still get a spot in a hall in general, but I might not get my preferred hall since I haven’t contributed much to it?

,Comment,1fbpdu7,Questions about hall allocation system,uniishell,2024-09-08 06:34:23+00:00,"1. yes
2. not sure
3. nothing is ever guaranteed when it comes to hall. u can only get the highest hall points (9) and apply for your preferred hall and unit, but really up to OCH to allocate u. usually 9 pointers shld be guaranteed la, 7 pointers a bit iffy alr, and 5 pointers on waitlist
4. u can apply room type, hall, and specific unit number
5. u can still get a hall, same probability as every other 5 pointer. Unless they’re a 5 pointer with rec list then they’ll be prioritised higher than u. 

U not getting your preferred hall won’t be because u didn’t participate in hall, but because 5 points is too low to be guaranteed a hall, so you’ll likely be placed on waitlist and OCH will just allocate u accordingly. i mean they will probably try to allocate u to your preferred hall, but ofc subject to whether there are still spots available 


i had 5 points in CAC for all 4 years in ntu, was a complete hall ghost and only using my room to eat and sleep and study and collect welfare packs. year 1 i was allocated single non ac at pioneer, and it was my preferred room type. year 2 i was allocated double at hall 10 with my friend. year 3 i applied for hall 10 single but was put on waitlist and eventually got allocated hall 10 double in mid september. year 4 i applied for banyan non ac single and was put on waitlist until mid aug and was eventually offered that.",8,0,,,,lm2qmtp

,Post,1fhc7sw,What’s your experience being an RA?,Physics-Head,2024-09-15 13:13:16+00:00,"Hi all! I recently got accepted as a research associate at NTU, after having finished my master’s degree. It pays well and I’d love to take up that role since I might do a PhD in a few years and having research experience is just great.

However, I’m wondering how it feels being an RA. I understand that every RA is different because you have different supervisors. But in general:

1. Is work from home possible? My home is too far and it’s a non-experimental position, meaning no lab work just paper work mostly.
2. How flexible are the schedule?
3. What’s usually expected being an RA?
4. Is it possible to publish some papers to get myself ready for PhD work?
5. Anything else I should know before I start?

If anyone has worked as an RA at NTU, I’d love to hear from you ❤️",23,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fhc7sw/whats_your_experience_being_an_ra/,,,
,Comment,1fhc7sw,What’s your experience being an RA?,hotshotmule,2024-09-15 13:28:55+00:00,"Points 1 &2 highly depends on your lab/supervisor/prof. 
3 - probably assist in whatever the prof needs ; that can include writing proposals, running the prof projects. 

4. Really difficult since you’re doing it for your prof/ RF/ PhD student, so you’ll most likely only be one of the author. Unless you can convince your prof that you can run your own project. Just a fun fact, typical science PhD students require 3 chapters for their thesis (so why not just do a PhD and publish 3 papers? Instead of “preparing”)

5. Find a good boss/prof? Try to get like a part time PhD position while being an RA if possible. However best case scenario is still being a full time PhD student WITH scholarship. Goodluck

im not a RA, but I’ve seen a lot of peers in my group that started as project officer and continued on as a part time PhD student under my prof while doing their PO work.",6,0,,,,ln8rgc1

1) Totally depends on your RO. If your Prof requires you to show face, you just gotta do it. I have managed some researchers who work purely from home unless there are meetings or presentations, to both internal and external parties.

2) Depends on your Prof. Most are not too tight on the start/end work time so long as you meet your KPI and milestones.

3) Take initiative. Come up with constructive ideas/criticism. Hit your KPIs. 

4) Definitely possible. Easier to publish as a team though. Typically in a year(for a freshie like yourself) should be able to co-author 4-5 papers minimum.

5) Get to know your team, supervisors(RFs & REs) and RO(your Prof) before starting. Helps plenty with some team understanding. Know how they work. Ask questions such as work arrangements and allocation.",1,0,,,,lnhlndu

(Probably means someone said the wrong date and nobody cares to check). Personally one day isn’t enough to complete the content but too late to think about that now. 

Format will not be a debate but rather two teams will take turns to argue their stance, the order of which team goes first should be set already. So for example, red team first, then blue team second. If you’re confused about how red team rebuts as the first presenter, you are expected to anticipate possible counters. Even if you’re blue team and go second, you do not need to rebut red team’s points on the spot. You do the same and prepare for possible counters beforehand. After both teams presented, there’ll be a QnA open to the class and they get class participation for asking dumb questions that you’re forced to answer.

So what you need to do now is find 2-3 ethical theories or whatever to support your stance, then 2 more rebuttals for possible counters. I seen some groups work with the other team to form their rebuttals but it’ll sound so smooth the prof will also know y’all cheated.

,Comment,1fnqeoj,help in studies,caibeng,2024-09-23 17:57:44+00:00,"Hey, I think many people have experienced this at least once in their lives, usually from burnout. 

Some good study habits are to condition yourself to study in a particular environment. For example, go down to the study room and leave your phone in your room. Force yourself to only study in that room. Whenever you need a break, leave the room.

Another one is to simply remove anything that distracts you from studying, like your phone. Just leave your phone in your room or use some free app similar to forest. 

Lastly, I think it’s important to take frequent breaks when you study. You shouldn’t completely cut yourself off from entertainment. 

Don’t feel guilty because this isn’t a mindset issue (although a strong mindset helps!). If you’re feeling particularly unproductive after a long day, it’s sometimes better to just go sleep rather than force yourself to study.",10,0,,,,lok6mxm

You can even find live ones to study together virtually. I go for the 50min work and 10min break ones. 


I also find that testing yourself is way more engaging then re-reading notes which is super boring. Maybe you already know but things like writing everything you can remember about the topic and then looking at notes to fill up the gaps, teaching the topic to an imaginary 15 year old and doing pyps are really good. I personally like to note down some fundamental questions when watching lectures so that I can test myself after the lecture/during revision.

,Post,1fpub9h,Which CS internship to accept for PI,LoveBurgerHateRice,2024-09-26 11:53:21+00:00,"After many applications and interviews, I finally received 2 offers today

A. Local cybersecurity SME < 50 employees:
- software developer, job seems pretty standard software dev intern type
- development/testing/documentation of the cybersecurity product
- probably working with full-time devs and can learn from them
- likely no WFH but slightly closer to home

B. Non-tech public sector statutory board:
- working on an existing project developed by previous interns
- project topic is hardware+software and is quite niche (IoT, IMUs, etc)
- work on project alone or with other interns, some guidance from supervisor
- 2 days WFH per week

Same pay and don’t mind the work of both. Currently no internship experience and my resume contains a few projects relating to the stat board project’s niche. Mainly from MDP and FYP. I am unsure if it is a niche that I want to pursue right now since I don’t want to limit my options this early on in career and fill my entire resume with this niche.

So I was thinking a generic software development role might help to balance out my portfolio. Also may learn more from working with full-timers (learn to work in corporate tech team etc) rather than working alone or with other interns (may be like school project).

However, 2 days WFH 😩

Would stat board or local SME look better on resume? Which one would you take in my position?",16,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fpub9h/which_cs_internship_to_accept_for_pi/,,,

,Comment,1fpub9h,Which CS internship to accept for PI,thelastsurvivor28,2024-09-26 13:45:29+00:00,"I would go with A. For internship better to have generic swe experience cos it will be better to branch out when looking for jobs (source: me who did swe vs friend who did pen testing in cyber). Also getting to work with senior dev as interns is SUPER important as you will get alot of experience while having almost zero expectations/resposibilities as intern. Whereas if you work on a standalone project alone or with other interns likely its going to be FYP 2.0, which in my experience was quite dry... But working in public sector will open you up to full time jobs there so if that's smth you're rlly interested to pursue in the future...

About the wfh, honestly while it was nice sleeping in and chilling at home I felt like working from office was a better experience cos can chitchat with colleagues, ask any paiseh questions irl, waste time with coffee breaks etc. If my current office is close to home I wouldn't mind full wfo.

So, I'm thinking about investing in an ergonomic chair, but I have two questions:

1. Where should I leave the dorm's provided chair if I bring my own?
2. Any recommendations for ergonomic chairs that work well with lower desks? The dorm table is kinda low.

,Post,1f886lg,NTU Gym (Asking for advices),Excellent_Courage861,2024-09-03 19:00:04+00:00,"I am thinking of starting to do gym at north hill recently. As I am a beginner, I would like to ask those who go to do gym frequently, especially the ones who didn't pay for coaching and started by themselves, how should I start? 

I would like to do gym because I think that I am too skinny and it was pretty cool to look muscular as a man.✨

I also know that I need to consume high protein food if I start doing gym.

So what kind of equipments / sets/ meals you guys suggest?

Thank you in advance. 👍🏻",14,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1f886lg/ntu_gym_asking_for_advices/,,,
,Comment,1f886lg,NTU Gym (Asking for advices),pahnze,2024-09-04 02:51:40+00:00,"Hello! There's a megaton of info online from Youtube to articles, but it can get overwhelming for beginners. Not to mention the amount of fakery and bro science. I'll try to simplify it, but any more experienced gymgoers can chime in. I was never coached, and had to figure things out for myself. Also, I was obese when I started, so not exactly experienced in going from skinny to muscular.

1. Going gym is like starting any hobby. Do things that you like, and that will lead to consistency and interest. As a beginner, it's not so important how many sets, reps or exercises you do. In. fact, I recommend you try out every machine and exercise just to see how each of them goes! Focus on learning how to move during exercises, avoiding injury and increasing gains.

2. Start simple with nutrition. Aim to slowly migrate to choosing higher protein, lower carb meals. This does not mean you eat chicken and rice every day. Try a variety of different meals, to get the full range of goodness your food has to offer. Unfortunately, a typical Asian diet is overloaded with carbs! As a skinny dude, you would want to eat more than usual as you start training, but I'm not well-versed3 in this aspect!

3. If you do fall in love with gymming, you can start learning about the different muscle groups. A general recommendation would be to try to hit each muscle group 2-3 times a week, with maybe around 2-3 sets. However, everyone responds differently to training, so figuring out what works best for you is part of the fun! (I do recommend for newbies to work more with compound exercises over isolation ones)

4. Don't be scared to make mistakes, everyone starts somewhere! If you're unsure of how to do a specific exercise, ask around and most people should be glad to help.  
  
All in all, enjoy training and try to be consistent! Newbie gains do go crazy. If you have specific questions for me, feel free to ask. (Sidenote: North Hill gym is often hella crowded, do account for waiting times for some popular equipment)",10,0,,,,ller1cu

Get more points than the average student applying to your room type. Generally 7 is a safe bet.

>when will my orientation points come in and be used for hall stay? is it in y2 choosing y3 hall?

For services rendered to a CCA in a particular AY, you will receive points that can only be used in the next AY.

>how do i choose my y2 hall?

In the yearly hall application? I'm not sure what this question is asking.

>i only have cca points and not hall activity points as i dont play sports,

There are no 'hall activity points'...? Only CCA points and rec list count in the yearly hall admission exercise.

>how can i proceed if i want to stay in my hall?

My prof posted some mock quiz questions on NTULearn, not sure if yours did the same. Make a good cheatsheet with all the functions you've learned and understand how all the functions and concepts work, then attempt the tutorials over and over again. The quiz will be pretty hard (average is like 60 I think) so don't be too demoralised if you don't score well. Bell curve will probably pull you up a bit.

AB1202 isn't really a muggable mod, it's mainly about knowing how to use RStudio to answer questions, so just practice using RStudio and you should be good

On a side note, it's probably hard to adjust but try to pace yourself for your mods. If you don't have time or capacity to study the materials, at least read through and attempt the tutorial questions before every class so at least you can understand the material, and by attempting the tutorial you're kinda studying anyways.

I’m a Year 1 student at Nanyang Technological University, currently working on my ML0004 assignment, which requires me to conduct informational interviews with professionals. The goal is to gain insights into various career paths, particularly in portfolio management, business analytics, and international trading.

I’m reaching out to see if anyone is willing to participate in a brief informational interview (about 5-10 minutes) to share your experiences and insights. I would greatly appreciate your time and knowledge, and it would be a tremendous help for my assignment.

If you’re open to it, please let me know a convenient time for you, and we can arrange the interview via Zoom or any platform that works for you.

The scope of the topics was released last week and there are honestly so many of them LOL I'm q lost as to which one to choose (more of like which one is the safest bet to get an A😅)

And the proj seems v focused on integrating practical applications with creativity and innovation so how do I achieve the creativity part since it takes up a large percentage of the grade (25% iirc??)🥹. Cause if we're gonna do stuff like green buildings/food waste it's probably too basic 🤡.

,Post,1fmni7p,Advice needed: I can feel romantic love very deeply but I can’t  feel family love at all. How can I make (or force) myself to love my mum in the same way? ,kmymchm_qyt233,2024-09-22 07:14:57+00:00,"I am terribly scared that I am a bad person for not feeling family love. 

Let’s start with media. Most people see me as the super emotional girl who always cries until eyes are swollen for movies, but here’s the catch: I ONLY feel touched by ROMANCE related movies. Yes, if (and only if) it’s ROMANCE related, whether it’s a movie,or a book, or just a short story, I always cry at the sad and touching parts. 

If it’s family related movie, whether it’s the recent Thai grandma movie about losing a grandparent to death, or any movie about a daughter losing her mum to death, I strangely shed zero tears because I don’t feel sad at all.

All the “try not to cry” challenges about parents sacrifice for their kids or about missing home, 0% evoke any response in me. 

Movies and shows aside, I cried when my best friend got married especially when they said their vows, which means I have a lot of feelings. But it’s only ROMANTIC feelings. I didn’t cry at all when my family relatives passed away. Yes, 3 have passed away so far, and they’re blood related, and you know what I thought? “Living until 100 years old is already an accomplishment, very good already”. So cold and logical!

Even if it’s just a  celebrity crush, I feel this sense of warmth in the pit of my soul as I think of him. I know what feeling it is and it’s a DISTINCTIVE  feeling from what I feel towards my parents. When I see my celebrity crush, or my real life boyfriend, the excitement and smile comes NATURALLY. When I see my parents, the smile comes POLITELY because I feel morally obligated to love them as a daughter, not because I’m genuinely happy to see them. 

I swear I’m not asexual or aromantic. I have had 2 boyfriends and I feel joy and happiness around them. I don’t feel the same feeling towards my parents AT ALL. 

If you count how many tears that stream down my cheeks for romance (over movies, novels or real life), it’s easily 100. If you count how many tears I shed for my family, I swear it’s 0. 

Are you supposed to love your mum in the same way as you love your boyfriend? I’ve asked around and they say we’re not supposed to feel the same way  for biological family or there will be incest and that’s wrong. 

I’m not asking “how to be a better daughter” because I know the logical actions. I’m asking how I can make myself love my parents at least to half the extent I love my romantic partners. ",9,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fmni7p/advice_needed_i_can_feel_romantic_love_very/,,,

I would cry if my romantic partner dies. Or if I watch something touching from ROMANTIC love. So it’s not my tear ducts problem, is also not I don’t have ANY love, there’s a SPECIFIC love I cannot feel.

I mean, I love my mom but I obviously wouldn’t want to have sex with her, so there’s your difference lol.

But seriously, I do urge you to really reflect and think about why you feel this way. 

You love your boyfriend because he loves you back no? You see the lovely little things he does for you, you feel touched and his good intentions make you feel good about him. That’s the love you feel for him. And if you like him enough, you’d want him to feel the same so you reciprocate by doing your own lovely little things for him. 

You don’t always do those things out of logic do you? You go to school even though you have no class just to pick him up after class to hang out even though logically, you could’ve saved that money on transport, save that money on dinner, save that time and work on your gpa. But you still do it. Because you love him and you know he’d do the same. There is no logic, at least not everytime.

Now put this in terms of family, you say you don’t feel anything when your family members die. Is it because deep inside, you feel that your family would feel the same if you died?",1,0,,,,locf24v

In the new syllabus, all labs focuses heavily on Solidworks which I can understand completely, since most companies don’t really use manual drawing anymore.

The final exam is still 100% based on manual drawing as well which I can also understand, because it is a useful skill

But dunno about everyone else taking the mod, are the lab sessions not really rushed?

It feels like Solidworks is barely taught during the lab, we just follow whatever the professor is saying and attempt to follow, with at most 15 minutes after the prof is done going through to do the question, which honestly is not enough – if you’re able to multitask and follow along that when the prof speeds through then you’ll definitely be able to do it but unfortunately not all of us (or maybe just me) are endowed with such a big brain ☹

What makes things worse is when the prof makes a mistake halfway and spends so long troubleshooting his own mistake, that it gives us even less time to do the question...

The prof and TA also do roam around and answer questions from students but when so many people need help and there is so little time, sometimes they won’t come to you until you need to submit

Some students (mostly from engineering courses in poly?) have background in this and therefore have an advantage (good for them, I’m not salty about that) but from asking around most of the non-poly students are struggling… maybe is just a skill issue though

Also sidenote, I have friends from other labs who can barely do ½ of each question but getting very good or good at least… shouldn’t the marking be more consistent?

I find myself spending more time preparing for this lab every single week than any other mod (or probably all other mods combined), watching YT tutorials on solidworks, doing the homework, but am still stuck with 3x satisfactory grade

Does anyone have any tips? Pls help a dumb person",9,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fi14kh/ma2005_ranthelp/,,,

Ah yea, fyi to anyone reading, their CAD drawings are 100% not ISO standard. Heck I dun even think it’s industry standard because on one of the drawings you can get both 1st & 3rd angle like wtf.

Also finals is not just drawing, but MMC LMC and your GDNT calculations. For me personally even though I’m very familiar with CAD (Autodesk Inventor), I was completely taken off guard by the exam paper. I would say go and find peer tutoring videos, for the calculations.

I have done so many past years and I felt that a lot of those questions are familiar. I was able to start properly for each questions but got stuck continuing it. So, my paper is just full of working but only a few questions with and actual final answer. Ik ik this test is just 10% blah blah blah. But then will we even have a reasonable amount of time for Finals? I genuinely very stressed out rn. 


Besides that, whenever I look at other ASEAN scholars, they don't seem to have any problem at all. Some who are doing Physics A, just claimed tht the course is very ez and they feel guilty abusing the gpa. The rest doing Physics 1011 just easily dismissed it as : ""tricky but it's ok"". The fact that I am expected to be as competent as them by the uni really makes me feel depress and even powerless.

 I felt like an imposter among them.  I have completely sacrificed my social life to try and maintain my gpa. while I see other scholars do stuff like researching things with profs from week 2 onwards, or taking up sem 2 mods like math and stuff. Idk how am I suppose to survive this mod while juggling other bs mods like eg1001, cc01, cc02, let alone even be on par with them.



I just don't wanna disappoint anyone back at home. And breach the asean scholarship and tuition grant contract. 


Please I would like hear some advise from the seniors


I genuinely wanna be better. I really do.

The only thing you need to do right now is to find resources to understand the concepts taught in 1011 lecture and tutorials, download textbooks from libgen / zlibrary and practice, get help from prof / peer tutoring and let those schoolmates of yours boast their achievement for whatever we care.

People may expect you to be competent, but you should expect yourself to be persistent and go through all challenges that you faced mentally. GPA results may not show the good grades that you want at the end of this sem, but do know that once you build up that mentality of yours, it will be a strong lifeline for upcoming semesters that will get tougher and nastier.

If in the end you still want to compare, take it as a motivation that there are lots of people stronger and better than u academically, and catch up to them using your holidays for self-improvement.

I have a couple of questions regarding how the grading works in this course.

1. If I decide to skip one of the components (or get an F for a single component), does that automatically result in failing the entire course? or if I decide to completely stop going for the classes itself because I intend to remod it cos I overloaded this semester, is it possible for me to get an MC and then dabao it?

2)I am suppose to commit->Send my Application to NUS from(Sway - [https://sway.cloud.microsoft/OUFXoE3rNuAWbQx4](https://sway.cloud.microsoft/OUFXoE3rNuAWbQx4) )-> Obtain acceptance from NUS -> course matching?

3)Is there a step by step guide from commit and onwards that is available online?

4)**You will be notified via email by OGEM once the course matching record had been updated in the course matching system after your acceptance.**  Like this means the acceptance from NUS Sway right?

Thank you so much",6,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fp08ox/susep_acceptance_questions/,,,

I applied to physics, ae&econ, ME, and ME is my last choice. I thought that there wouldn’t be any difficulty in getting into physics because one friend with similar bg got into physics and one friend with much low scores get into EEE, but unfortunately I only got my last choice ME. I have appealed before the sem started, to switch to physics, and to math for many times but all of them were rejected. 

I still wanted to change programme cos I’m more into the math and physics and don’t want to do the engineering thing (it seems too realistic). 

But the current situation is that I couldn’t add any core course of the preferred course cos my time table is too full. Also I have a second major in biz, which isn’t what I really want to learn and I don’t expect it to pull up my gpa.
Anyway, I don’t have core course in the wanted major, I have a second major which will probably pull down my gpa.

I wanted to know if there is any chance for me to increase the possibility of getting in math or physics major after sem 1? I know it’s hard, but this will influence my future and I really wanted to do things in physics (or math).",5,21,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1firpth/change_of_program/,,,

As a student myself i know how hard it is to find like minded individuals that share the same passions, hobbies and goals as i do. 

Next to that it's really hard to find the right companies or startups to work for or do an internship at.

Because of this i decided to build a platform that connects individuals with the right professional opportunities as well as personal connections. So that everyone can develop themselves.

At the moment we're already working with different universities and startups around the world that believe in the idea to help people find better and authentic connections.

If you're interested. Please sign up below so we know how many people are interested! :)

2. Depends on which major but if it’s CS, then your best bet is NUS but it’s quite hard to secure mods in NUS based on personal experience. So you might end up taking some cores in NTU. Tricky part is sometimes they clash.

3. No easier chance since it’s a program, and SUSEP requires close to full GPA for decent chance, and doesn’t guarantee it either since there are limited slots like 25 per school iirc.",3,0,,,,lmgnsx8

Do you get lower priority for NUS mods? And what can you do if thats the case?(Like try to do it earlier? Or email their school for mods?)

What about other schools like SMU? I think I would be able to map most of y2 mods for SMU but for other schools the website doesn't show anything much.

,Comment,1fdlkxm,SUSEP CCDS,RecruiterS1,2024-09-11 05:27:14+00:00,"No, we don’t get lower priority. We will be bidding the mods just like a regular NUS UG form round 0 to 3 iirc, or BOSS system in SMU. But definitely, some mods are more exclusive which I can’t rmb since they have exact pre-req that only NUS/SMU offers to their student. 

Since you are from computing, SMU might easier to get in compared to NUS, on areas like competitiveness and reputation ig. But don’t quote me tho haha, i am only sharing from what I heard so far since there isn’t an official channel to show what is the min GPA you must get to have a decent chance for each.",1,0,,,,lmk9or2

,Comment,1fe79z5,PH1198,Peannuutt,2024-09-11 12:50:34+00:00,"No it's not really worth 2 AUs. It's more like a 3 or even 4 AUs mod. When I was in year 1, I spent more time on this mod writing reports and drawing graphs/diagrams than my other 4 AU modules. This is because you need to allocate time outside of lab to write the report. Especially if you are aiming for A- or A. At least the requirements for PH1198 is still reasonable as the first 2 reports are half-report iirc. Subsequent lab modules are all full reports. However, if you are interested in research in the future, it is a good starting point to learn experimental, report writing and coding skills. At the end of the day, all Physics students have to do it. So I would say just do your best and hopefully enjoy your time trying out the experiments. All the best!",5,0,,,,lmlhqbb

Would like to find out how do you know which uni offer programmes for NBS, and even if the overseas uni that I would like to apply for don't have business in their coursework, can I still apply for it and will I even be considered for it? Would be glad to hear from seniors who have experience themselves as I am abit confused, thanks!",3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fed30t/question_for_gem_explorer_nbs/,,,

If you're not doing an NBS course, it means you're exchanging BDEs instead of MPEs which might not be worth it. These plans will change based on which course you don't want to take in NTU (basically, if you can, choose the hardest courses to take overeas because it becomes pass/fail)

There's semester exchange (gem explorer) and also summer exchanges, LIP etc that can be taken by anyone. Can consider those too. What uni are you thinking of and why?",2,0,,,,lmmw2wh

also, I'm thinking of taking econs coursework in UTokyo if I'm not going to be doing business coursework, but if I'm going to choose business coursework, I'm thinking of going to Europe. But I will be more inclined to studying in Japan

wanted to try exchange in Japan as I had a friend who did his internship there and it looked quite fun LOL, I did visit him at Japan as well and I had fun there.... I know being an exchange student there and being a tourist is very different but I think it's going to be a new experience that will enrich me. As for Europe, I have never been there before so I'm going to take this opportunity to travel there. 


Have you done any exchange programmes before or applied for it before? would love to hear more about it!",1,0,,,,lmpd07k
,Comment,1fed30t,Question for GEM Explorer (NBS),depetir,2024-09-12 15:19:07+00:00,"If you see the [NBS website under ""curriculum""](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/education/undergraduate-programme/bachelor-of-business#curriculum) you will see that there are some ""broadening and deepening electives"". Basically these are the courses where you can choose to take anything at all (some people take NIE sports or art mods, some take languages, etc). MPEs are major prescribed electives, basically related to your school but there will be a list of modules to choose from. I'm not familiar with nbs specialisations, but you will get a different list of choices whichever specialisation you choose. There's also core modules (basic y1 mods where everyone will take) and ICC modules (interdisciplinary courses where you do some saikang like ""healthy living"". I was the last batch before icc was introduced so I did not take this). 

Course exchange policies differ by school, but for MPEs, most schools require you to match your exchange course to an existing course in NTU, so the contact hours and course content has to be similar at least. There is no requirement for any match for BDEs. Afaik most if not all schools don't allow exchange of core or ICC mods, so most people just find the hardest mods (that may or may not be a prerequisite to other mods they want) they need to clear exchange.

Also, i think NBS requires you to a ton of internships, so you can go overseas for those too. 

But if you're taking 3-year course you pretty much have to go exchange in year 2, which means you have to do very well GPA wise in y1, because some unis are Very competitive and the gpa cut-off ends up being 4.5 or something because the selection is based on year and then gpa. 

I'm sure there are plenty of universities in japan that have business courses and not just UTokyo. A lot of universities might also have language requirements. I went to paris for exchange, it was fun (pm for more info).

If you're free you can go look at the courses, the course descriptions, search up feedback on which course and prof is bad (lmao), exactly which courses and specialisations you want to take, which courses have which prerequisites, and which semester they are offered in. You can even map it out in an excel sheet.",1,0,,,,lms0619

Also does anybody has a timeline in which NTU rolls out the admits for Jan intake? Or anything from which you can track your application

So I’m an M24 IB student, I got 32 points, my lowest being a 4 in HL psych and 6 in SL math AA, which isn’t high thus I’m unsure. I went to an american international school here however I’m Singaporean. 

I didn’t think I’d get into NTU cus my predicted grades were really low, and I’ve commenced at a private uni (bachelor of PsychSci) rn. I’m looking to apply to NTU for psych too, however please recommend courses that are easy to get into LMAO 

Anyways I couldn’t find an indicative grade profile for IB students so I have no idea if my, albeit low, score has a chance. My only niche I can apply with for ABA is music (ABRSM grade 8 in piano) however I feel like it’s not related?? Can I apply with that? 

Furthermore.. by the time May (results release) comes I’ll have paid a LOT of money for nearly half my current degree. The issue is that I find NTU more worth it as it’s a 4 year program with honor placement a good possibility, while my course currently has 300 students competing for the very limited 20 honors year  placements. What I didn’t realize that to even get a job or proceed into masters, a 3 year degree as I’m doing right now is barely valuable, which is why I’m looking to get into a 4 year course, be it psychology or not tbh

If anybody has any advice, please do let me know<3 I’d be really grateful",0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fnnlbf/low_ib_score_is_it_worth_to_apply_aba_advice/,,,

,Post,1fcse7i,Change of programme,suyouyou,2024-09-09 15:36:41+00:00,"

Hi, I’m a freshman in NTU now majoring in ME. I want to change my programme to physics or math. (Previously I like physics more but now I see that undergrad physics is not that interesting I would like to grab more math stuff and study physics in grad time)

I applied to physics, ae&econ, ME, and ME is my last choice. I thought that there wouldn’t be any difficulty in getting into physics because one friend with similar big got into physics and one friend with much low scores get into EEE, but unfortunately I only got my last choice ME. I have appealed before the sem started, to switch to physics, and to math for many times but all of them were rejected. 

I still wanted to change programme cos I’m more into the math and physics and don’t want to do the engineering thing (it seems too realistic). 

But the current situation is that I couldn’t add any core course of the preferred course cos my time table is too full. Also I have a second major in biz, which isn’t what I really want to learn and I don’t expect it to pull up my gpa.
Anyway, I don’t have core course in the wanted major, I have a second major which will probably pull down my gpa.

I wanted to know if there is any chance for me to increase the possibility of getting in math or physics major after sem 1? I know it’s hard, but this will influence my future and I really wanted to do things in physics (or math).",1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fcse7i/change_of_programme/,,,

What I can suggest is that you work out a project with a professor and discuss the timeframe with him/her as some projects take longer while some can be completed quite quickly. From there you’ll know whether to take a bisemestral or 1 sem FYP.

As for the pros and cons, bisemestral definitely gives you more flexibility in terms of time as you’ll be studying and doing your FYP for 2 sems and the project won’t be so rushed, more room for error compared to a 1 sem FYP (15 weeks only). However, the downside is that you’ll be studying while you’re doing your FYP so balancing between the two will be important

You need to know that the clubs in uni work differently from sec sch/JC etc. In uni, you join for one AY only, unlike sec sch/JC where you joined since the start and stay till u grad. So definitely every AY, you aren’t just competing with your batch mates but with year 1-4 peeps in uni. 

Also, a few seniors may stay over in same club, and def are preferred over newer members due to their experience but I am sure the respective clubs keep the intake for seniors to the very minimum. However, there isn’t a must rule to accept a lot of freshies too or like how many they must take in.

In 1980, Nantah merged with University of Singapore to form National University of Singapore (NUS). This marked the end of Nantah.

In 1981, Nanyang Technological Institute (NTI) was founded on the former campus of Nantah. NTI was established as an engineering college.

In 1991, NTI was officially renamed Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and became a full-fledged university, expanding beyond engineering to offer a diverse range of courses such as History 🤣",56,0,,,,lofbnbc

Poly learning is geared towards a more industry-based form of learning and they train you for work because by the end of it you get a diploma relevant to the industry that you are going for. I suppose it’s something like an apprenticeship but with tests, examinations or coursework and presentation.

Meanwhile JC is more towards a conventional school system where you learn a certain set of subjects based on what subjects you decide on and then after two years you go for your A levels. I would suppose it’s much more similar to that to a high school.

What I can offer is this, certain subjects in Uni are more suitable for the JC path, and others for Poly. So it’s up to you to decide.",5,0,,,,lodeb0i

I highly suggest taking the poly or IB route instead of JC if you're coming directly from year 10 in PH to Singapore. It's not only a gap in education standard but also education type, the way SG teaches in JC is different from my experience in PH since everything boils down to your final A level grade (so it's just 2 years of studying for 1 test) and it feels like the system is very much built on SG's primary and secondary school education system

Poly would be more similar to the style of education in the Philippines, you work on projects that have tests in a cumulative grading system + when you graduate you have a diploma in whatever you specialised (If you're sure about the field you want to go into)

Another option is IB (international baccalaureate)

https://www.moe.gov.sg/international-students/admission

as for poly, its also on a case by case basis but because poly offers a wide range of courses, the intake is much much much larger than jc, so the chances of entering would be higher. different poly have different processes for admission, some would require u to sit for interviews/entrance test. different courses would also have different requirements, with things like pharmaceutical science being harder to get in than common business programme since the former has a smaller intake and is hence more competitive.

poly and jc are VERY different educational pathways. u can think of jc as middle school but x100 intensity. eat sleep study every single day and just keep grinding. poly is like a mini version of uni, u have different courses and take different mods every sem, and graudate in about 3 years with the final year being a fyp/internship. most people choose based on their style of learning since poly is more hands on as compared to jc. poly also focuses much more on consistency where your cgpa is used for uni admission, while u can flunk and fail your whole jc life but u just need to do well in the final major exam to make it to uni. some people work well under stress, some prefer it to be spread out. it really depends on u. poly students would graudate with a diploma at the end of 3 years, which is recognised, while jc students would graudate with an A level cert, which btw is pretty much useless if u dont make the cut to enter uni. 

however u also do need to take note that poly does restrict your uni choices a bit more than jc, such that the course u choose in poly would kinda dictate what courses u can and cannot take in uni. for example a poly business student would not be able to enter uni courses like med/dent as that would require a more relevant diploma, whereas jc students that took sciences would be able to enter pretty much anything under the sun in uni. 

there are only a few polys in sg - tp, sp ,nyp, np, rp. all poly offers similar courses but they all specialises/are known for different stuff

No point having those if your main achievement is not that good unfortunately. Even in primary and secondary school, those extra curricular activities are meaningless without top tier grades. 

On another note, engineering also depends on what type of engineering. I think u stand a chance for mechanical engineering if your aptitude for it is good, like how much do you know about actual theory and practical in mech engineering.

Already took the AS this May and just need to finish up the paper 3 & 4 for all the subjects now; did my mock tests and got A\*A\*A (improvement from A\*AA from the AS' final results). The school I'm in doesn't let me take a fourth subject (cause of course restrictions and funding) so I've told my mom that it's pretty infeasible to go to Singapore with all things considered.

Like, hypothetically, if I were to add some research papers I've written, uni summer schools I attended last 2 summers, and stuff would that increase my chances in getting into NTU.

What are my chances of getting in?,EstablishmentAny5956,2024-09-09 16:14:42+00:00,"I am an Indian high school student from the United Arab Emirates who studies in the CBSE (Standard Indian) school system, which follows rather different marking patterns to Singaporean or American schools. I would love to join you all for my Bachelors in Aerospace Engineering next year! Here are my stats:

* My SAT Score - 1570 (790 Math and 780 R&W)
* I've scored 95% in my 9th and 10th grades but messed up my 11th grade and ended up with 85% in that year.
* I'm currently in my 12th grade (which is my final year in school) and will most likely end up with another 95-96% at the end of this year. I've taken Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Computer Science as my subjects. I really would love to know what the ideal marks would be here.
* IELTS score: 8.5

**My extracurriculars:** It's a bit of a mixed bag here. I'm the leader of the Science-Ecology-AI club in the school and am the Deputy-secretary of a charitable student group that I helped found. I've also been on the student council in various capacities since I was 12. I have taken part in quite a few basic level science programmes and innovations fests and stuff, but nothing spectacular. I also have 4-5 inter-school quiz victories under my belt. The thing is that the extracurricular scene is not nearly as vibrant in the UAE as it is in Singapore or the US.  
I know Python to an intermediate level, but have quite literally no programming projects of the scale that a lot of people here seem to do. I could cook something up in the next few months if you guys think it would make much of an impact on my application.  
Then, to the wildcard: I am a bit of a proficient public speaker. I've been to 18 MUNS (of which I chaired 4), which I'm assuming won't help much with an engineering course of this sort. Plus, I've also been part of the school debate team and have 4-5 events' worth of experience.

 

As I am an Indian student, I'm sure that the admissions folk would expect me to take JEE as well. What do you guys think would be the ideal score? My strongest suit is arguably my SAT score, but do they count SAT scores only for American Applicants, or would it make an impact in mine too?

Anyway, what do you guys think??",0,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fctbxz/hello_futurecolleagues_or_so_i_desperately_hope/,,,

You can judge for yourselves, as the bus accelerates fast and attempts to run me off the road by lane changing in the junction, just to lane change back. Once the bus has to slow down, bus driver high beams while i am entering the roundabout.

Such hooligan behavior is tolerated by [shuttlebus@ntu.edu.sg](mailto:shuttlebus@ntu.edu.sg) and they are not even going to follow up with this matter by giving me a lukewarm reply.

*""****Incident Near PIE Pioneer Exit Junction****: Due to the layout of the terrain, the bus needed to shift slightly to the right to make a sharp left turn safely. It was observed that the motorcycle was driving in close proximity to the bus, and the bus driver briefly used the high beams to alert the motorcycle of the situation, not continuously as previously suggested.""*

This action endangers all road user and shuttle bus passengers. I hope this will shed some light on the current shuttle bus situation. Everyone stay safe out there.

TLDR is that there are 2 guys going around trying to get into girl's DMs. There are a 2 tiktok videos of girls talking about this harassment issue.

One of the vids has a recording of these 2 guys' attempts. I do agree that it is cringe and that there are much better ways to approach girls than that but the comments have taken it too far. Their actions are at most a nuisance with temporary consequences such as the girls fearing for their safety. The comments and videos are instead publicly shaming them, divulging their personal information, cyber bullying by making fun of their appearances and etc. Can we agree that this is taking it too far? One has temporary consequences for a few girls while the other is a stain on their reputation for the internet to see. 

I think everyone's learning in Uni, we are still young so this is the period of time where everyone is still making rookie mistakes (commentors, tiktokers and the 2 guys included). 

Please try to empathise with all the parties involved as well as in future conflicts. NTU seems to have alot of issues already and from what I can see, its really stems from a lack of empathy sometimes.

EDIT: Just to get things straight,

Harassment is bad i agree but it has gone beyond addressing the harassment issue. We are harassing the harassers to an even greater extent than they have started with. (as explained in the comments)

There are other better ways to handle this instead of blowing it up. We can file a police report, inform NTU to track these guys down or talk to security. Get someone of authority to stop these behaviours hence stop the harassment. 

The rookie mistake is how they are approaching girls. It seemed like they thought their stunt would work. Harassment is the outcome of their rookie mistake and that shouldnt be tolerated, anyone in their right mind would understand that their way of approaching girls will cause them to be uncomfortable. When I mentioned ""we were all there once"" I was talking about the part where we were all new to approaching girls once. I wasnt about us being new to harassing people once.",0,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fml6zw/we_need_to_practice_a_little_empathy/,,,

additionally, this isn’t others lacking empathy. this is the guys lacking mannerisms. if any girl/guy says no to you asking for their IG, your response should be “sorry for disturbing” and walk away. (ofc i note that there was one guy that apologised — on the bright side, we have one that has manners yay!)

and i love the way that you talked about temporary consequences on the girls as if a girl being harassed irl is lesser than a guy getting harassed online (speaks quite a lot about your character).

(disclaimer: i do not condone cyber bullying nor reverse harassment) imo the fked up part here is the persistence and just not backing down when the response is negative. the simple fact is these 2 clowns are mature enough to anticipate the consequences to their own actions.

I don't disagree that this should be reported to the authorities, but social consequences is necessary to prevent not only them but also other people seeing it to not do the same thing. why is it such a bad thing to tell other women that hey these guys will make you uncomfortable so avoid them at all costs. it's also not  a bad thing for their linkedins to be shared so that future employers can know not to employ people who may harass the women in their workplace.

I'm not sure I get what you mean. so you say that anyone in their right mind would understand that this way of approaching girls isn't permissible – so do you think they were not in their right mind when doing this all the way since the start of the semester?

Bell curve exists, and assuming you did your LAMS as 99.9% students would do, the majority from SoH break no sweat churning out writing assignments at least in the same level of quality you produce in the same amount of time, whether op-ed, reflections, journals, reports, and youre making it seem like as if doing the bare minimum of doing lams and not plagiarising chatgpt which most are probably smart enough to understand anyway is enough. And no, other than lams, you cant finish your deliverables in a day without compromising its quality, i thought thats common sense. 

Hell, im from CCDS, and I still did bad for CC1 after having to rewrite my op ed TWICE from scratch just to give a perspective. People dont put that much effort into it because they know how hard it is to get an A in these mods when they are competing against significantly better writers, so they rather focus on their core mods instead, where they have a much better chance.

However, just because many core mods also have LAMs to be done, doesn’t make it Impossible to neglect ICC LAMs altogether…because they’re different mods…and that as the other commentators have mentioned they have lesser interests on CCs than their cores, which could make them more careless.",1,0,,,,lsi705d

However, where did I say that doing lams and not chat gpting stuff was enough? I just said that group work isn’t all there is to ICC. I mentioned submissions too didn’t I?



In my previous comment, when I said that these things could be done “in one day’s worth of commitment, I wasn’t trying say that everyone _must_ complete said assignments in a day. I meant to say that the total time they accumulate to do them would amount to maximum a day, meaning it’s still possible to do so. You’re of course, free to distribute the tasks for each project across several days, provided there is a consistent progress. 

If you’re afraid that doing it in just one day could compromise in its quality, then just come back another day to review and refine it as many times as you like till submission? 


For reference, in ML4 I spent 0.5h interviewing the alumni, 1hr to edit, and 2 more to write the reflection, all on the same day. This isn’t counting the previous 2 days I spent to find and request for interviews though.

I was pointing out the fact that youre clearly trivialising the problem to say that merely submitting deliverables is enough to get good grades, which is obviously not true. The crux of the issue is that its just not worth the battle to put in as much effort to get good grades for these useless icc as the core mods since a lot of us are at a disadvantage; its not a skill issue when the curriculum is designed to cater to some groups more than others, and the fact that the latter has to be the one to put in more (consistent) effort to try to even the playing field at something they are not even remotely interested in does not help the case, does it?",1,0,,,,lsifpsk

And it’s not even guaranteed that _all_ of them could publish better reports than you could, regardless of advantage. Conversely you got to keep in mind that there are students every other faculty who also have the capacity to write well. 

Pretty sure only focusing on deliverables still doesn’t trivialise the problem because they literally account for 75%+ of your grade and you’d be in big trouble without submitting them. Plus, I did already acknowledge the presence of other uncontrollable factors such as group mates and the bell curve. Only reason why I narrowed down on the deliverables was because you asked me about the how students hating ICC more skill issue than something they couldn’t control and I’m telling you that these are the parts.

,Post,1gd8pai,We need to normalize small talk,Valuable-Junket9617,2024-10-27 11:17:26+00:00,"In light of all the discussion regarding loneliness, I think one of the issues I've noticed here in NTU or Singapore is how people seemed to not be receptive to small talk.

 Whether it be in the elevator, or someone sitting next to you at canteen, I believe if small talk isn't instantly dismissed as ""why is he talking to me"", it could instantly help relieve a lot of the loneliness people feel, I'm sure people would rather talk to someone than scroll insta reels alone at the canteen.

 Everyone is so scared to start a conversation as they feel like they need a proper event to be at or 100% justified reason. 

Not everything needs a reason, it could just start with smth simple ""hey you a MAE student"" or ""hi, I've never had that food, is it good?"".

 I've noticed many intl or exchange students do this so casually like it's nothing, but sgporeans very rare they feel like they need to be in the same class, event, or hall to even start talking.

A lot more connections and loneliness can be solved, be brave and let's start talking more!",368,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1gd8pai/we_need_to_normalize_small_talk/,,,

,Comment,1gd8pai,We need to normalize small talk,_Vilgax_,2024-10-27 14:49:19+00:00,"Most comments on the posts about loneliness here are usually on the lines of ""be more comfortable with spending time alone"" or ""use the time to focus on work or improving yourself"". Does socializing not hold any value anymore? Is life all about isolation and self improvement? If I'm at a point in life where I'm comfortable with myself and getting my work done, then am I automatically not supposed to crave human connection?
Wanting a friend or someone to talk to can be exclusive to how comfortable you are with yourself or your focus on work. It stumps me how everyone is just looking down at their phones on the bus, in class, at the gym, EVERYWHERE. LOOK AROUND YOU, THERE'S MORE TO LIFE THAN PIXELS ON A SCREEN! 
I tried my best to socialize and it has gotten me nowhere so far. I regret coming here more and more everyday. It would be appreciated if people, at the very least, smiled or greeted each other and were fine with exchanging a word or two.",12,0,,,,lu0k8lf

But my experience when i do get them goes like this. Me a singaporean who lived abroad, back in sg. Does small talk, gets a strange look, then ignored. My self esteem 📉📉📉. 

i realise that its easier to small talk if you are attractive. If you have something interesting to say but youre unattractive, the other person may reply back but will do their best to cut it short. Not allowing the initiator to make a conversation. 

But other than that, with my neighbours, i always say hi, have a goodnight, and other stuff if i see them frequently in the elevator or in the walk way. Then from there it builds comfort and then you can slowly strike a conversation. 

Same thing if you frequent a shop/cafe and you find a familiar face, a person who frequents the place too. You might want to make initiate small talk with them. Singaporeans are kind on the surface, and if you arent the type to care about their inner thoughts if they are strangers then it doesnt hurt to initiate small talk. You get to talk, they get slightly bothered. Your mood may go up, while theirs go down. But if both parties can communicate well then its a win win.",2,0,,,,lu3f36z

But when i walk and i lock eyes with someone, ill give them a nod if its a dude, or a smile if its a dudette. And if we stare at each other long enough i might just say hello. I guess its because im comfortable and confident in myself(?). 

I realize on the train that people slouch alot because they are on the phones and what i find really ugly is the hump they have at the top of the spine. I do my best to watch my posture, so that i dont have it, and plus having good posture is a good sign of confidence, but anyway, if they have that, its a good indicator that they are always on the phone.

And about the first half of your post, its a way to cope with your loneliness. As it may lead to depression, knowing that there are people who have gone through the same thing and telling you that by focusing on yourself you wont feel lonely, in itself not as lonely right? Knowing that people understand your struggles and youre not alone in doing so? 

Good that youre comfortable with yourself, that you have ways to escape having the feeling of loneliness. But there are some who dont know who they are because their whole life, they have been trying to appease others. Because yea singaporeans have that mentality that if youre not worth my time/entertainment/status/interest then youre pointless to me. And yea thats true in most societies and not only exclusive to singaporeans. And so as a result they just build up walls, becoming close minded, and then only opening up to those they find worthy of something. 

Majority of the time exchange students are more open minded and outgoing because they come knowing that they are needed to make friends to help them get around, and opening up to people makes it easier. For singapreans, they marvel at the idea of having foreign friends, resulting in them easily showing interests.

,Comment,1gd8pai,We need to normalize small talk,kayjaylaw,2024-10-28 02:41:12+00:00,"As someone who used to struggle with small talk last time, I'd say it's still very possible to make small talk even towards end of sem. The trick is finding a topic that most people can relate to (""How are your quizzes & assignments like?"") and establish some camaraderie in your shared misery first. Then ask questions that sound like you are asking for advice (""What do you do to de-stress?"") and then the conversation will move past the small talk stage into something more personal but not too uncomfortable still.


Obviously not everyone will reciprocate your initiative, but keep in mind that most Singaporeans are usually more surprised than offended that someone is talking to them, and sometimes people just can't react in time. Pick up the conversation 5 minutes later and see how it goes again; if not, you can always chat with someone else.

In Koufu that’s the western stall, the vegetarian stall is also worthwhile as the auntie gives quite a fair bit. For foodgle I recommend their western food too at Hall 7 and Binjai Banyan Halls.

Mala has spices to make you feel full, and you can hack it to make it weigh less but still be enough for me I put:
2 x instant noodle
1 x thong serving of chicken
1 x egg
1 x fishball
1 x enoki mushroom
Should cost you less than $12 + student discount I roughly get $11.70 now.

But she isn’t responsible to the SU anymore. She has done irreparable damage to the SU’s reputation, but she doesn’t owe the SU anything as she has relinquished her responsibilities. If she’s still the standing president, sure she is accountable for the image of the SU. But I don’t think it’s fair to hold her accountable for an internal organisation that she’s no longer apart of. 


The precedence would be that if she’s had criminal charges against her, then that would be a different ball game as she is still part of society at large and is liable to its dues. However, you are asking her to apologise for her actions for? If she chooses not to, why must you force it out of her? Her personal image also in the gutter she don’t want to repair it is her own business.

My only intent in asking was cause I was curious if she had did something bad against you personally, thus the barrage of posts. I don’t know her personally and I don’t have any desire to add her to my circle, but it just seemed odd that you came after her so hard when she pinned the comment. Kyleson was also an exco member, so why not him too?

In short, i shared a story of hearing people advocate intrusion military operation, which make me uncomfortable and simple ask people not to do the same.

It is very upset and worrying to see increasing portions of extreme voices in our dearly campus. Not even mentioning some crowds are actually in support of such opinions.  

The intention of that post is to rise concerns of potential conflict and risk of social groups confliction and abuse among NTU' vivid population. From personal prospective, I feel no longer safe when knowing such words and laughter is being tolerable by individuals. During whole process, I follow de-escalation measures to avoid unnecessary conflict; yet, I am being call coward.

As the discussion in that post progresses. Two assumed students, which one actually supports military activities, decided to file a report case to NTU 's whistleblower. And accusing me intentionally cause hatred on Chinese population.

In response of that,

First, I repeatedly stated it is matter of individuality. No people should be judged under overgeneralized groups. I even specifically put effort to stop that. This is the fundamental mindset I have as cosmopolitan. Secondly, I think it is very wrong doing for even supporting any kind of collective military activities, not just Taiwan-china one in this case, we all know how Russia-Ukrainian, Israel-palestine cases unfolded to be. Collectice conflict is just meaningless and wrong doing.

I think it is a very good chance for NTU to update their inclusion and anti-hate policy from adminstrative end. I expect it would be crucial things to have in next 15years, in order to create a safe and sound environment for academic. As I expected, more disturbance from global relations. Integration and prosperity is the key quality of us. 

The student who sent out the report said he will share reply from NTU office. If turn out there is no wrong doing from my end, I demand them to publicly apologize to me for calling me racist.

Meanwhile, I am planning to contact NTU and Taipei Representative Office in the Republic of Singapore to clarify the existing measures on students' safety and anti-harmony speech in campus.

,Post,1gd4lcx,I Feel So Alone,Independent_Sell6211,2024-10-27 06:13:22+00:00,"I am a final-year student staying on campus. After 4 years of staying here, I felt more alone than ever. I have tried several things to meet more people but I can't seem to gel with most.

Although I have made close friends, they are usually not in the same place as me, meaning they are not those who stay on campus or seniors who have graduated. Some of those I am acquainted with have their friend groups, so they don't call me out frequently as to them I am not their top priority. This means that I am usually alone, and I can't go to activities with friends like how other students can. While I bit that bullet and still go to events by myself anyway because I know I can't have friends around me always, it is still a fact I am usually alone.  

To a certain portion I am acquainted with, they are also friends with people who have mistreated me. For brief context, when I was working with someone in a residence's exco, I had a partner for my position, but she kept insisting we weren't working well with each other just so she could distance herself from me to work with her crush, who is holding another position. It left me feeling confused and rejected for a long time, thinking I really did something wrong to offend her. This person, with control of that department after sidelining me, managed to get into everyone's good graces. Now that the club has been passed down, I distance myself from mutual club members as they know some of the situation but they don't seem to care about the fact that I got mistreated. Some of them do not seem to care when I am not around. We had an ex-club group to plan activities together, but they seem to have plans made in another group chat, as I was unaware of any plans. What made this painfully obvious was when they saw me around these activities alone (as mentioned before, I still tried to go to events alone and meet new people) but they acted as if they were a separate clique (like how if you go with a friend group to an activity but you meet a separate friend but they don't automatically join your existing group), which reinforced my decision to stay separate. It stung most with closer people I know from the club, who were closer friends with that person. As a result, I don't feel myself around these people as their friendship with her despite knowing what she did to me is a validation of her mistreatment of me, especially when they partake in that clique notion and forget about me whenever I am not involved. One of the club members even acted disingenuously, only joining me for dinner (I usually sit alone) when they have no company, but the moment they have company (even mutuals) they act as if they do not know me. A third member had betrayed me before, and his actions thereafter just tell me he doesn't cherish me as a friend at all.

  
After a lot of soul-searching, I think what stings the most is that no one remembers me when they are having fun. No one calls me out to hang out just for me, even after 4 years here. Even friends I have who do not stay on campus seem to have closer bonds with others. 

I remember the times in secondary and primary school when I loved to show up so I could hang out with friends. Now I am just existing day to day, just focusing on my work. The new people I meet seem to already have their friend groups and do not seem keen on calling me to hang out anytime.

Objectively, I do not think there is anything 'wrong' that I did. I tried to get to know as many people as I could, but most people were already occupied with what they had. I may have doomed myself by distancing myself from the aforementioned group of friends, but I see no benefit in hanging around people who forget me that easily or do not cherish me. I see this as not at the right place at the right time. 

But damn does it feel lonely.",185,49,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1gd4lcx/i_feel_so_alone/,,,

Friends or close friends left/sidelining me when i'm not as entertaining/socially acceptable  or do not possess anything that they might have advantage over with although there are some people i met in secondary and high school are still quite kind as I might have seen (?). Its kinda sad because I don't blame them as its just how the culture and system here make people tend to be patronising towards others and in extreme cases there aren't any genuine relationships at all . At times, I just feel that international people tend to be more understanding towards me ? However, I still constantly feel that people are still not accepting me due to how negative experiences from my past form an echo chamber within me. Maybe meeting people from other parts of the world or living overseas might help to regulate our beliefs?

You have done enough for yourself. However, don’t build ur life full of relationships. Try to find a hobby or a show that you are interested in. Having friends is great but if you focus too much on forcing yourself to find a friendship, you might start to dislike the process. It is supposed to come naturally. 

If you are feeling distressed, you can try finding a church for soul seeking or maybe organise outdoor meetings with your friends as well. Don’t wait for someone to start, you can start now too :)

Reading your other posts, I realise one thing about you. Do you normally start conversations or do you wait for someone to start? Relationships build up over time and you should take some effort to strike a convo or maybe join a small grp to eat with them instead of waiting for someone to invite you.

,Comment,1gd4lcx,I Feel So Alone,Odd-Locksmith2091,2024-10-27 23:20:04+00:00,"Honestly, ive had this phase for the past 4 years, after covid hit. And all my international friends left the country to study abroad and i had to serve Ns. And within that time, i realised that rather than forcing yourself to make friends or relationships, its better to use that time to build yourself, because by doing so, theres atleast something you can be proud of, and in the future you can share it with others. For me, during this time I just focused on my hobbies, reading, drawing/painting, i even started going to the gym, and picked up crocheting. But also if you want to make friends find someone with similar interests with you. For me it was playing ML during ns, and after ns i asked a guy my age if he wanted to study or play ml together, from there we got to learn about what we liked and what not, we dont talk often, we have those silent moments where we just enjoy each others presence. But when shit hits the fan, then we both understand and listen to each other issues. The good thing is that, we have our similarities in things we like but we have differing mindsets that, from my point of view, allows us to learn from one another. So i see him like a brother, and i appreciate him very much.


Other than that, i did have a group of friends that hung out with me from time to time when we were all in Sg, but i was somewhat of the outcast. And i slowly realized that they didnt respect me as much as i wanted them to. But whats the point of forcing it onto them, and yearning for it? Its just going to lower my mood, and so i actively decided to cut them out from my life. And things were happier, as i said it earlier i picked up on some hobbies, i did msg the one i was close to but i still kept my distance. So dont take your loneliness as a negative, always find the positive side to things, and i know there will be times where its damn lonely, ive had and felt those times alot, but youre alive, so just push through, no one is made on this earth to be alone. So just focus on yourself. Thats how you make yourself interesting. 😁",2,0,,,,lu3b551

I have seen true bosom friendships start from primary school, I have seen 'friendships' where one party is using another party for various reasons.

Is like most of the Singaporeans I come across seem to only maintain friendship if there’s a transactional benefit to them and without these they won’t bother to be friends with you and will try to sideline you gradually if they don’t see the benefit of talking to you, not even if you message them and etc, perhaps I’m just unlucky but I don’t see a shorthand of people who experiences that

Also as a guy I find that majority of Singaporean girls I come across like 6-7 out of 10 seems to have a stuck up mentality that a guy being friendly towards them equates to being interested in them and will proceed to immediately be colder to the guy if she thinks the guy is “uncool” or slightly “introverted” or along the lines of that.

Singaporean students like to help each other in education not like the international students kept to themselves as if scare others to outsmart them. That’s the culture in NTU.

On the surface, they are nice and stuff , but you cant or hard to decipher what their true intentions are because we all are trained by the system or inherited beliefs passed down from our parents' generations in such a way to please others no matter how much we dislike it or not or to compare who is better etc. Thats very sad and some NTU local profs are like that either discreetly or subtly though some are v nice and approachable. I think majority comes from the upper echelon of the society where they have the elitist and condescending mindset as evident in many Singaporean educators though there are always exceptions. I think it all boils down to the nature of our system and it's very sad no matter how much the government tries to downplay these emerging societal issues such as mental health, cost of living , stress etc. , we will always have this prevailing culture of thinking negatively in almost every situation we encounter in our lives as we are being taught from young to either subconsciously or consciously to conceal our feelings in order to avoid being alienated.

Then last Monday, which is when my prof first time taking over for the tutorial session, the same thing happened but this time after the same guy from previous insrances left, his prof personally came in and ask to use the classroom BEFORE 6:20pm, my prof literally said to the other prof “we are ending at 6:20pm, please respect the students(me and my course mates)” and I can feel the tension between them lmao.

After thinking hard and long, I've decided to step down as the moderator of NTU's subreddit. Throughout the 2 years of being a moderator, NTU's subreddit has grown much and it has always serve as a platform for freedom of speech and students to voice their concern. I have seen student movements come and go that started from this subreddit and have went on to have positive change towards NTU.

So why resign? Well the answer is simple, I simply do not have the mental capacity/motivation to deal with all the drama found in this subreddit.  To all the people out there, when in Rome do what the Romans do, never go against the societal conduct of your host country. I learnt that during my time outside of Singapore and you should too.

As I know many uni students may be taking up tuition assignments for side income, I would like to warn everyone how NYA is known to **NOT pay tutors** on time or just totally DEVOUR their hard-earned money. There is a Facebook group with **20+ tutor victims of NYA**. I have already joined and shared my encounter inside there. » [https://www.facebook.com/share/mmem8bmzHt92tKVQ/](https://www.facebook.com/share/mmem8bmzHt92tKVQ/)

I'm a current full-time tutor who has not been paid for 4 assignments taken up with NYA, totaling to a sum of >$200. I have shared the details of all my experiences & evidences in that group.

I have attached sample job postings by them. If you’ve registered on their website (nanyangacademics.sg), you may receive SMS / iMessages from these numbers: 98772966, 91778598 for their assignments. \[Business contact information is not protected under PDPA. ([https://singaporelegaladvice.com/.../suspect-pdpa-data.../)\]](https://singaporelegaladvice.com/.../suspect-pdpa-data.../)\])

As a NUS alumni who have been UNPAID by this agency **TWICE** (as an undergrad in 2017 & now again as a full time tutor), I definitely do not wish to see fellow tutors & uni students deal with this horrible agency like I did. When exposed, they were unapologetic & adamant about not paying me unless I remove my posts about them. 😠 Furthermore, agent Ethan has **THREATENED** **ME THRICE**, in response to my posts calling them (NYA) out. I have already submitted the evidence of all his threats to the police and investigations have begun.

Please spread this message out to all your friends who are working as tutors, as currently it’s the exam period when demand for tutors is high! Also, please join the group if you have / are facing similar situation related to NYA, as we are planning to join forces & take further action against them.

**The above are my statement of facts and fair comments based on my actual experience with NYA, with the intention of raising awareness among Singapore tutors regarding the TRUE practices of NYA, while police investigations are still ongoing.**

,Comment,1fxfwnv,🚨About Nanyang Academics (NYA) tuition agency🚨,Louis-Litt-1972,2024-10-11 13:56:37+00:00,"That's insane. It's 2024, and the complaints against Nanyang Academics (NYA) keep coming. It seems that more tutors are stepping forward, all sharing the same story—work completed, but no payment. Reports also claim that Ethan Lau Hock Chuan has been threatening those who speak out. If true, he’s treading dangerous ground under Section 503 of the Penal Code (Chapter 224), which covers criminal intimidation. The police won’t ignore this if it’s valid. Reporting these threats is the right move, and it could lead to a formal investigation.

Tutors thinking about working with NYA need to know the reality. Even freelancers have a right to be paid for their work. Under Singapore’s Contract Law, agreements are binding, and payment must be made when services are delivered, provided the terms of the contract have been met. While the Employment Act (Chapter 91) does not cover freelance tutors, the principle remains the same under contract law: you do the work, you get paid. Public awareness is key to preventing others from falling into the same trap.

This isn’t even Ethan’s first issue with the law. In 2021, he was caught underreporting over $400,000 in income, leading to a 5-week jail term and a $141,600 fine—triple the evaded amount, as per the Income Tax Act (Chapter 134), Section 96, which deals with penalties for tax evasion. If the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) did strike off Nanyang Academics as a fellow Redditor has mentioned, it would mean the company lost its legal standing to operate. According to Section 344 of ACRA’s Companies Act (Chapter 50), a struck-off company can’t simply resume operations without proper reinstatement, which requires addressing outstanding issues and filing a formal application.

Yet, Ethan appears to be running NYA again in 2024. This raises serious questions. Did he follow the legal steps to reinstate the company, or did he find a way around the rules? ACRA’s regulations are strict, and any gray area deserves scrutiny. ACRA and the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS) should look into this—whether it’s a proper return to business or a repeat of past behavior. Operating without proper registration would violate the Companies Act (Chapter 50) and carry serious consequences.

For those aware of this situation, ACRA and IRAS need to dig into how Ethan Lau Hock Chuan is still in business. They need to see if he’s genuinely changed or if it’s more of the same. Their role is to ensure a fair business environment, that rules are followed, and that workers get what they’re owed. If things don’t add up, they have the power to correct it. For the tutors like you who have been affected, it’s simply about receiving what you've rightfully earned—no more, no less.",1,0,,,,lrev6w4
,Comment,1fxfwnv,🚨About Nanyang Academics (NYA) tuition agency🚨,Chemical-Oil-1788,2024-10-06 14:42:54+00:00,"Thank you. I have emailed MOM about this but I think their reply is not very helpful 😅 Think I'll try small claims ;\_;

MOM's reply:  
We are sorry to hear that you are experiencing salary issues with the company.

We wish to share that a [contract OF service](http://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/contract-of-service) is an agreement in which one person agrees to employ another as an employee, and the other party agrees to serve his employer as an employee. The employer would need to provide the statutory benefits as spelt out under the [Employment Act](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/employment-act/who-is-covered) such as annual leave, sick leave, etc., for all employees engaged under a contract of service and contribute CPF (for Singaporeans and PRs) under the CPF Act. 

On the other hand, a contract FOR service is an agreement in which a person or an entity is engaged as an independent contractor, such as a self-employed person or a vendor engaged for a fee to carry out an assignment or a project for a company on a freelance basis. Under such work arrangement, there is no employer-employee relationship, and the person will not be covered under the Employment Act and will not be entitled to the statutory benefits under the Act. As statutory benefits do not apply, the terms of engagement will be according to the contract agreed upon by both parties. The person, however, is required to pay compulsory MediSave contribution as a self-employed person.

Whether you are an employee or independent contractor would depend on the actual work arrangement between the two parties involved. As MOM is not a party to the contract, we are not in the position to advise on the nature of relationship between the two parties.

If you are of the view that you are an employee under a contract of service and would like to file a claim for statutory benefits under the Employment Act or a claim for contractual benefits, you may do so with the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM)[^(\[1\])](https://sg.mail.yahoo.com/d/search/keyword=mom/messages/89093?guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9sb2dpbi55YWhvby5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEZcZ58MZlzSLPq541FPFnr4o5-cWwrb6jdBKyids7D5vGGlHuv7F-1qWemsjSKMIi5_RrbZFxYTIeEaVC7jDse8XOyppeGAMuux8Bpm7grkVd3Zrc2gXPTsO4K5QjEePuu_EqHYx-I6c7yIzZhGirv3I15eOqaYlhlhK-0Yu_vF#_ftn1).

You may file your claim online or make an appointment to consult the TADM officer via [https://www.tal.sg/tadm/eservices](https://www.tal.sg/tadm/eservices). The officers will evaluate your situation and advise accordingly on the options available.

Do note that the timeline to lodge a claim are as follows:

·         Still employed by the company – within 1 year after the dispute arose.

·         No longer employed by the company – within 6 months from your last day of work.

If your dispute is not covered by employment laws, the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM) may offer you mediation if civil actions have not started. If you are a self-employed and your dispute is payment-related, you may approach the Small Claims Tribunals (SCT) or TADM may also refer you to the respective sector agencies to provide the necessary assistance.",7,0,,,,lqmerpx

So have you figured out bro, why ST, PAP, SPH collectively in concerted effort year after year publicize the laughable clown single joke ranking by a British tabloid magazine Times where NUS is not ranked in the high 80 and lost of other rankings rank NUS so poorly? #80 plus is a big improvement. For the longest time NUS is >#100 in CWUR and ARWU and the Norwegian ranking.

Dude, let me tell you something. All these rankings mean nothing because people outside Singapore either don’t know NTU exists or if you tell them about it in a sentence, they think NTU is a Chinese university located in PRC (haven’t heard of it and assumes it’s Chinese based on the name)

I’ll explain to you why the above situation happened and that SG universities are actually poorly ranked worldwide (rankings or not globally they are unknown) and how PAP selectively takes one or two shady rankings to publicize to try to elevate NUS.

I went to a London university that’s considered #3 in the UK before going to over to the US. I did a discipline in the hard sciences that involved research that requires funding. The difference between the UK experience and the US experience in teaching quality, infrastructure, resources, research achievements, precious networking opportunities with the world’s movers and shakers to be and wealthiest princelings, and most importantly, access to grants from corporations, and funding for graduate research was like heaven and earth, chalk and cheese, super different… the US being far superior.

If even the most prestigious universities in UK aside from Oxbridge can barely compare to public funded state universities in the US, where do you think NUS let alone NTU stand? Due to shortage of funding, UK universities have been suffering from mediocrity and irrelevance for at least two decades, they’ve been sustaining due to the rise in outgoing Chinese and Indian international students. Other than Oxbridge, you don’t hear any research achievements coming out of British institutions for a long time. International students are their bread and butter of survival, so they (the Brits) themselves produced their own rankings (The Times and tabloid and QS) to prop up their decaying institutions. They also give favorability to the universities in their ex colonies. That’s how only in these random shady ranking, NUS appears in the top 50. Do you or NUS people actually believe that NUS is better than Cornell or Brown? That’s so cute. Sad, but cute. Oh gosh if they hold something that no one outside Singapore takes seriously and is comical at worst, so close to their hearts, it’s sad.

It doesn’t take Einstein to know why they turbo charge efforts and propaganda locally to promote NUS. SG after all depends on foreign investments through MNCs to survive, and if MNCs know, perceive or appraise the workforce of that Mario to be not good enough, would they set up shop?

But why do you think the government plucks out two random shady rankings out of half a dozens or more out there to publicize?",0,0,,,,ls7ic02

I guess this a rant and also a lesson for whoever wants to take it in.

Don't fuck around, don't hook up.
I made a mistake of trusting this girl, who apparently fucks around. She told me her bodycount was 2, nope it was 20+. I got HSV-2, HPV and Hep-B from her, i only have myself to blame. Never trust anyone. Always use a condom.

Then just a reminder, even with condoms you can still get Herpes and HPV. It's never safe. Get protected by getting HPV vaccine, don't have so many sexual partners. Keep it in your pants guys/girls. It seems fun and all, but it's never worth it to fuck around.

,Post,1g4wvjx,Help,Individual-Dig-3192,2024-10-16 11:15:02+00:00,"As an international student in Singapore, I’ve been dealing with something that’s been bothering me lately. Every time a local girl invites me to study in her room, it ends up being about everything but studying.

2 weeks ago for example, I got asked to study for an upcoming exam with a girl from one of my classes. She seemed serious about it, so I thought, great, this is going to be a solid study session. But once I got to her place, it didn’t take long before the conversation shifted from textbooks to something way more flirty. I could tell pretty quickly that “studying” wasn’t exactly what she had in mind. At first, I tried to ignore it and focus, but it became awkward when it was clear that her real intentions had nothing to do with exam prep.

It’s not the first time this has happened either. I don’t know what it is, but it’s frustrating because I really came here to do well in my studies, and I feel like I’m getting distracted by situations like this. Whenever I decline and try to keep things strictly about studying, the atmosphere becomes tense, and it ends up being awkward. I lose a potential study partner, and the whole situation leaves me wondering whether I’m ever going to find a group that actually takes studying seriously.

I understand that everyone’s trying to balance their social lives with academics, but for me, my education is my priority. I didn’t come all the way to Singapore just to mess around, especially with how much my family is investing in my education. So when this kind of thing keeps happening, it feels like a roadblock to what I’m really here for. It’s gotten to the point where I’m hesitant to accept study invites because I don’t know what the real agenda is.

Are SG girls all so open? What can I do moving forward? 

to those in my dms asking me to intro, please don't ask. ",107,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1g4wvjx/help/,,,

Must be y1/y2 as some of us may feel like life has been dry and try to live the so called great college life in movies. Still, shouldnt be pushed onto you. Attention isnt always fun.

One way to politely entertain but stay firm is to go to very known study areas. Like the library/gaia/anywhere everyones focused. 

Another is to also sometimes simply lie and say you're not available/are studying with someone else from a different circle.

(Small Rant para) I have a similar problem with an international friend of mine who thinks shes cool, cold and serious (bless her soul) but is a floofball that talks a lot when we do sit down, but I dont have the heart to tell her to quiet down. I keep pausing lecture despite being plugged in, smile and nod, but she doesnt get rhe hint and I just dont manage studying. So, sometimes, I kinda don't open the notification if she asks that I'm around to study, because as nice as she is, I need to get my studies going sometimes. Although, this is more wholesome/platonic comapred to your situation.

I will admit though, yes, despite srudying with friends, I *do* also kinda (very hopelessly and sadly) like a guy I often study with, but thats because he inspires me to do better haha. So I genuinely focus when we study together at library/school/anywhere. No, I dont come onto him, neither will I. He's a friend first, crush second.

No, not all SG girls are like this though. Promise. Some of us may be and then transition later into more serious ones when we realise we actually want to do better and learn better. But no, not all of us are like that.",5,0,,,,lsbkcsp

Honestly speaking girls that thinks like what I mentioned ain’t gonna make good life partners cuz superficiality is in their mind, that’s coming from someone who encountered these types of girls and also encountering girls who judge people by their character, like one of my female friend from poly, I am still friends with her even after I confessed to her about my feelings for her(which she didn’t accept due to understandable reasons), and yes me and this girl still talk and meetup occasionally. 

As for the girls that fall under the superficial side of things, there’s one time I just asked this girl I met from a school event whether she wanna meet for lunch and her reply is “sorry not interested heheh” then got blocked, fyi I asked both guys and girls indiscriminately because I just like to meet new people.",2,0,,,,ls6rtb4

Girls at that age and who want an easy and early sexual experience would target a noob guy who doesn't have high  expectations or standards. To be fair, guys this age are worse than them in general, so, if this is a common thing, you can kiss away the notion of you being good looking, hot, fit, etc. In the real world, people find it easier to aim lower.

NTU’s DSAI curriculum teaches you all the CS fundamentals + some specialised math. You can get a job at almost all CS fields except the hardware based ones and cybersec. However, it is up to you whether you want to switch. 

Also, it’s not that Data science is dying, it’s that companies have been doing it wrong the whole time (riding on the “sexiest job” hype train etc etc). They’ve been hiring pure data scientists, which of course doesn’t offer great value proposition since most bachelor DS don’t have much domain knowledge or statistics to make the best decisions, and don’t have enough programming knowledge to maintain ML/ Data infrastructure 

Most companies need proper data infrastructure (and maybe data engineers), people with good domain knowledge, and good statistical and programming expertise (especially SWE knowledge!) who then learn or happen to know data science. This is why they prefer masters/phd for data roles! They will eventually figure this out, which is when you’ll have the advantage. 

As for AI, I agree, without a PhD most roles are just glamourised API integration of pre-built models. But hey - DSAI/CS trains you for that too. And no one knows to what extent this technology will be used ",78,0,,,,lqfdjd6

,Post,1fycheu,What to do about NTUSU?,nantahscrubber,2024-10-07 16:53:03+00:00,"Hi. This is that one committee chairperson who made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/16pe9tc/im_a_former_su_subcomm_chairperson_and_im/) about the systemic issues underlying NTUSU last year.

Watching this year’s SU saga unfold, I was going to write something much earlier in the semester; I couldn’t help myself. But then, suffice it to say, life happened. Anyway, I just saw that the NTUSU AGM will be held tomorrow night, and thought — why not strike while the iron is hot?

In the run-up to the AGM last year, I actually had some points written up for the crowd I’d assumed was going to show up. Unfortunately, I never even turned up, and it seems like nothing changed as a result of the AGM. I’ve since graduated, so technically I’m an outsider. But I still feel like none of my points have been made at all by others. In fact, I’ve seen a lot of outrage, which is justified to be sure, but which has only led to kneejerk reactions. The fundamental issue is one of (mis)understanding what a student union is supposed to *be*.

## What is a student union?

Nanyang University was established in 1955, in a largely grassroots effort by the Singaporean Chinese community. The linguistic divide then between the English-speaking and Chinese-speaking subsets of Singapore’s population was far greater than it is today. One hallmark of this divide, of course, was the split between schools whose primary medium of instruction was Chinese versus those whose primary medium was English. Nantah, as it was and still is fondly known, served students from the former.

Of course, this divide would eventually be torn down within the span of a couple of decades, and the proliferation of English in Singapore became a part of Singapore’s national myth-making. ~~God-Emperor~~ Lee Kuan Yew, in his Infinite Wisdom, foresaw that Nantah’s medium of instruction had to change. What was that? Students organised and staged a protest against a 1965 report by Nanyang University's Curriculum Review Committee? This won’t do. Expel 85 of them.

Clearly, this hotbed of dissent had to be completely restructured with his famous and universally beloved Iron In Him. So in between Operations Coldstore and Spectrum, LKY found some time to consider what was to be done about this wayward child, and invited one Oxbridge-educated Brit Baron Dainton in 1979 to weigh in. Surely he knows what’s best. Dainton said Nantah had to be cannibalised by the University of Singapore; and, in 1980, so it was.

So how did NTU come to be? In 1991, Nanyang Technological Institute, the engineering school that took over Nantah’s carcass, merged with NIE to form the NTU we know and love today. This includes the NTU Student Union in its current form, replete with its ties to NTU’s administration. The history of NTU — and, by extension, NTUSU — is the history of sanitisation.

Is it right that a student union meant to represent our interests and meet our needs, to speak in one voice for the less privileged among us, be beholden to the university? Just like how labour unions must often orient themselves in opposition to employers and bosses (except in Singapore, cough cough), student unions often find themselves in a situation where they must make concrete demands of the administration. It does so by organising the student body and leveraging strikes, teach-ins, sit-ins, and other forms of student action.

But this has never really been the understanding of the secretive and unfairly chosen few who have run the NTUSU exactly as intended: a blathering, defanged mouthpiece of the university. Is it any surprise that the rot of racism came from the former president? SU is just a game to these people.

Unfortunately, the student population has acted exactly as expected: we took it lying down. Nobody cared; nobody cares.

But it doesn’t have to be this way. What is needed is *political will*. Where does this will come from? The ability to imagine a better student union, one radically reformed based on transparency, democracy, and independence.

### Transparency

Union leadership should commit to frequent and transparent communications with the student body, through channels like emails and physical townhalls. Dialogue should always be a two-way street.

Appointed union officers independent of the EXCO should also keep students informed and updated of whistleblowing incidents, investigations, and so on.

All union officers should hold themselves to the highest standard of accountability. You have our trust. Don’t break it.

### Democracy

The highest role of president should be decided upon by popular vote, rather than by the votes of elected representatives alone.

We should be able to immediately recall elected representatives, for any reason.

Beyond representative democracy, the union should provide platforms for direct democracy: Initiatives to improve students' campus lives should be open to all.

Importance should be placed on informal leadership of projects, like level of involvement, *not* just formal leadership roles. Students should be rewarded for the work that they do.

Candidates of key roles should meet and maintain strict criteria for conduct.

Any manipulation by non-elected representatives, even past EXCO, will strictly not be tolerated.

### Independence

All decisions and demands by the student union should be made purely in the interest of students. Demands. No more asking politely like teachers' pets, no more rolling over. Compromises should not be made lightly, and students' efforts should not be swept under the rug.

The union should only align itself with the faculty and rank-and-file of NTU, and not with its management.

Agreements should be worked out with SAO to streamline administrative processes and minimise red tape. This includes the creation and ratification of official clubs & societies.

Depending on how we as students work this out, finances will be managed as independently as possible.

They should also be reported regularly, externally audited, and made publicly available for students to review.

Any evidence of influence from external sources should be investigated immediately, and the officers involved will be removed from the union permanently.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the student union should operate under no influence whatsoever from SAO and NTU.

## Is it really possible?

I want a transparent, democratic, and independent student union. I’ve seen it in other countries, other universities, and it works. Their unions are actively involved in the campus lives of students, because they care. They don't just hand out free bubble tea every now and then, or pretend to take initiatives like Purple Loop and Finaid Friends seriously but give us nothing but radio silence months later. They definitely don't try to cover up misconduct.

This all requires laying the necessary groundwork. It won't be easy. But a truly representative union wasn’t a matter of choice for me, and I don’t think it will be for you all. It *must* happen. There is no other option. And so no amount of difficulty should deter us. To those who feel like you are alone in your frustrations: you are not alone. To those who feel like your worries are meaningless and your hopes for fellow students are unrealistic: they are not. And to those who feel like you have no power: you do.

Come together. [Tear down](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/4/1/uc-referendum-results-yes-wins/) the hollow and decaying cadaver of the current NTUSU, its constitution and its regulations.

For me, I would say the first sem was the hardest (and the one I scored the lowest for), partially because of post-NS brainrot and partially just because I didn't have the mindset to push through and study so I ended up procrastinating and doing everything damn last min which led to a severe mid-sem burn out. After that I learnt how to portion my time better, set aside time to decompress, talk to friends/seniors for discussions/general yapping, and most importantly how to study and take in information more efficiently and thoroughly.

Remember, it takes time to improve, so don't be too hard on yourself -- growth is not linear! Another thing is that, yes, the modules do get harder, but you also get better with time. :-)

I’m not sure what average GPA is but university is usually when you realize what it actually means to study lol. It’s a big step from high school. If you want better grades:

1. Work harder, no way to avoid this. Are you going to every class (irl as well not offline bs)? Are you taking notes? Are you doing exercises? Are you asking questions to the teacher?

2. Be more strategic. This takes a while to get a feel for but basically: What kind of questions do you think will be on the test? Is it heavy on theory/proof or applications? What do you think the teacher focuses more on? What kind of questions have they asked during assignments etc?

3. The funny thing about engineering and math is that more work doesn’t necessarily mean better results. Try focus on quantity over quality. Sometimes I will spend hours on a single question just to understand a concept deeply, but once I have I usually know it perfectly and can automatically solve those type of questions like a machine. Look up feynman method as well.

4. Try to relax before exam. This will keep your head clear and make it easier to think when you encounter a difficult problem. 

If you do this hopefully you should improve. I did this and maintained around ~4.9 / 5.0 during my entire bachelors. 

Best of luck, if it helps I also thought that year 1 was the hardest. Now in my masters I’m a lazy piece of shit but still get pretty good grades because I spent my undergrad mastering the basics",5,0,,,,lucxawf

But is there any way to do it secretly ah haha. Cause I have my bag with me so I am afraid it's pretty obvious. The prof doesn't mark attendance but I am afraid that he will notice it and then mark me down LOL. Like should I put my bag somewhere first, like a library or something. So it won't be so obvious.

Friendship is supposed to be a slow journey , not something that can be accomplished in one day. You are doing far greater than I am tbh, and I could see that your efforts will pay off :). Don't worry too much, most of us tend to be quite introvertish so the problem might not be you but the people you are trying to friend with.

honestly don't know where to start, but im feeling really overwhelmed right now, and it's harder to keep going. this sem has been incredibly tough - the modules arent my strength, and no matter how much i try, i feel like im just not getting it. plus im only involved in 1 cca, but the commitment is so intense is so intense that it feels like im drowning. im rlly worried about my GPA, its not that good to begin with, and i can feel it slipping even more, which just makes everything worse.

lately, ive been questioning if im in the wrong course altogether. the more i struggle, the more it feels like im not cut for this. whats making it worse is that next ay is already Y3, and it feels like my GPA is going to be so hard to pull back up. i know i need a decent gpa to apply for exchange and internships, and im terrified that if i don't get the internship i want, it will mean no job conversion/opportunities after graduation. it feels like everything is hinging on these next 2 sems, and the pressure is suffocating.

its hard to feel adequate when all my coursemates seem to be so on task, getting things done, and here i am, feeling stuck and behind. it's such a strange feeling because throughout pri, sec sch and JC, i was always the one people came to for help. i was even from an elite JC but now... i dont know what happened to me (not that it matters anymore, but it just feels like ive fallen)

the stress has been building so much that my chest feels tight a lot of the time and ive started getting headaches on top of everything else. i don't even know how to manage it anymore. im struggling to sleep at night because all these thoughts keep me up. then the next day, im too exhausted to function properly, and the cycle just repeats. im rlly worried about my future, and i feel like im wasting time even writing this, but i dont know how else to let this out. i havent talked to my friends about this because i know theyre overwhelmed with their own stuff, and i dont warnt to burden them with mine.

Just wanted to let you know that you are not alone on this. I also faced a somewhat similar situation back when I was in uni year 1, i constantly tell my friends every sem that i want to quit school. But here i am now being a y3. At this point, i am going on autopilot to just go through it and complete the responsibilities and work i need to complete. However, I have also learnt to talk to my batchmates more about my struggle and surprisingly they were very open to help me along on topics and work that i am unfamiliar with or lost with. Speaking to my professors for specific classes also helped alot. I make use of any after class time even just a short while to clarify on things i didnt understand during the lesson, and the professors were more than happy to help. I once fear that people are too focused on themselves and will not be willing to help, but i came to realise it was the opposite. So the more i asked for help, the better my situation became, I also managed to form a stronger with my batchmates and talked to them more often/even do assignments tgt.

I think whats important is to ask yourself ""whats best for me now"" and continue on from there. Honestly speaking exchange is a privilege and an option you don't have to go and although its partly true that you need a decent gpa to apply for internships, CAO is there to help you. Some companies aren't even looking at GPA but rather more towards your soft skills and what you can contribute to the company.

source: i've done multiple internships and jobs for teaching, marketing, and journalism even though my degree is completely unrelated! you can generally pick things up on the job within a few months, employers are looking out more on soft skills for these career paths, my bosses have even told me that they used nothing from their comms degrees in their actual comms career :)

what's your subject combi in j2? what fields are you looking at right now? ik some might say otherwise, but my personal advice is to either choose a major with a high return on investment (for careers that need highly specialised knowledge) or to choose a major that you're genuinely interested in. there are no easy majors, and 4 years will feel like forever if you're not at least decently interested in the subject.",2,0,,,,ltu5fhi

Gotten internship without interview. Was a GLC. Exact company, I leave it up for you to guess.

Experience:

1. Allowance was lower than what other people were getting from interviews.

2. More than likely, the position you are getting is mostly done by outsourced overseas contract workers. So end up you will be treated as one.

3. You don't learn anything useful, probably won't be assigned to a team in the company and work solo. Likely only be assigned a work supervisor, that's it.

4. Typically, there are no OTs. Most of the time, no one bothers you also. Basically, give u a task and a dateline.

There is a guideline for the dollar value threshold (of the gift), above which they would need to declare to HR and all that. Some of them hate the hassle, and prefer not to receive anything (one of my profs set down his policy in Week 1). Seeing you succeed in life is reward enough for them.

You could write the best damned essay out there, but if it doesn’t align with the prof’s expectations of the syllabus, you will not do well.

If your prof does not communicate their expectations, then you need to ask them directly after class (or drop an email). But from what I see, most profs do tell students what they expect during lessons—just that most students don’t note it down for later reference. In my sem, they generally wanted:

- lecture concepts
- diagrams/visuals (these are powerful when used right)
- compelling evidence of your (successful!) journey
- a reflective style of writing
- some analysis specific to my prof not covered in the lecture 

These should already give you an idea of the outline. Introduction of topic -> rationale -> methods used to counter/remove unhealthy habit (with links to lecture concepts) -> description of journey -> conclusion of success.

Don’t make the journey sound easy—make it sound realistic and interesting. Talk about how you failed until you introduced another method, etc, then conclude about how much you learnt.

Dont write too much for something worth less than 20% of the rubrics. You want to put in more effort into the components that are worth 30-40%. Now got chatgpt so should be even easier. I did some vibration sleeping device that improves sleep and mental wellbeing. I dont actually own that device but I wrote it as if I do. Then I spit some bs about how I would rather sleep earlier even if I havent studied finish for a quiz the next day because health > grades.,5,0,,,,lrj3arc

,Post,1g5p58r,A picture of the law,Own-Pineapple-2979,2024-10-17 11:57:31+00:00,"Given the emotionally charged comments being thrown around from all sides the past couple of days, I believe it is prudent to take a step back and review the concrete law as it is in Singapore. Whatever emotion you may feel, we are all subject to the rule of law and individual vigilantism or good samaritans is unsurprisingly not condoned in Singapore law.

Preliminarily, it is prudent to state two things:

First, this account is anonymous to protect my identity. My position is one of neutrality. I do not care what the geopolitical situation is; life is already hard enough. But I do enjoy my current relationships with my friends of all backgrounds on campus, and the last thing I (and I assume many of you) want to see is a quasi-civil war on campus.

Second, I would like to quote the moderator in the first instance: 'In sg there are consequences to what u say, surprise surprise freedom of speech in sg is technically limited contrary to popular belief.' This is absolutely correct. It will therefore apply to what the supposed PRC people said, Alarmed\_End693's Reddit posts, and all the comments on all sides of the conflict.

With this in mind, the facts must be set out clearly.

First, assuming that what the PRC people said is indeed true (we side-step the lack of evidence issue), then they are clearly in breach of s298 and s298A of the Penal Code. Both of which will be quoted here (https://sso.agc.gov.sg/act/pc1871?ProvIds=P415\_298-#pr298-):

s298: Whoever, with deliberate intention of wounding the racial feelings of any person, utters any word or makes any sound in the hearing of that person, or makes any gesture in the sight of that person, or places any object in the sight of that person, or causes any matter however represented to be seen or heard by that person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 years, or with fine, or with both.

s298A(a): Whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, knowingly promotes or attempts to promote, on grounds of race, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill will between different racial groups.

This would immediately be the end of story. A simple report would guarantee consequences.

Second, however, as noted, there is no good samaritan law in Singapore. Nor is there a 'self-defence' law where if you were a recipient of a racist comment, entitles you to reciprocate with a similar comment.

The issue here therefore, is whether Alarmed\_End693's comments 'attempts to promote ... disharmony', or 'commits any act which he knows is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different racial groups and which disturbs or is likely to disturb the public tranquility' (s298A(b)). The notable standard here is one of reasonability on a balance of probabilities.

While Alarmed\_End693 constantly states that his comment is not meant to be xenophobic nor racist, such comments will not be accepted in a court of law, since blatant words could be contradictory to the actual mental state involved. The courts in adopting a fact-based approach would therefore look at evidence like:

* For students who feel it may cause impact on you, I apologise. Just bear with me for a while, i think it is the process of changing we must gone through. (https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1g56333/comment/ls8ntws/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button)

This reasonably suggests that Alarmed\_End693 knows about the potential impact their comments have, but that it should be tolerated because they have an ideal outcome to be achieved. The strength of this is up to the authorities, but many examples follow.

* The myriad of blatantly racist comments following from the post which Alarmed\_End693 does not condemn.

Alarmed\_End693's case is therefore weakened, as at the very least it shows that they are reckless about their behaviour.

Third, this is not to point fingers at one perpetrator. Many individuals who commented on the post on both sides could similarly be hit with attempting to stir disharmony.

At the end of the day, there are no good guys in this story. I therefore urge restraint on all sides to calm down. The reasonable response by Alarmed\_End693, in the eyes of the law, would be to record the PRC individuals and report them to the NTU authorities, which would then be settled amicably by the school board. This alternative, while justified in its end goal of promoting harmony between all races and groups, has clearly backfired. De-escalation through escalation is not looked upon fondly by the authorities. Being a vigilante does not pay off in Singapore.

P.S.: I am not interested in engaging with this post. If the comments here get out of hand, could a moderator please lock this post.",23,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1g5p58r/a_picture_of_the_law/,,,

Second, even if the law does allow for such exceptions (most commonly in self-defence cases), which I repeat does not arise here, the relevant test for reasonability is proportionality, which has a convincing case of being disproportionate here. 

It is important to note that taking matters into your own hands, i.e. 'step outside those constraints' is the precursor to social anarchy dependent on individual social views and thresholds, a position the law in Singapore does not sanction.

,Comment,1g5p58r,A picture of the law,Own-Pineapple-2979,2024-10-17 12:48:17+00:00,"Hi friend, thank you for your comments. I believe that a dialogue to a pressing problem must involve all sides! Although I maintain my neutrality, I do totally agree with your comments.

To crystallise my point further, I guess what I am saying is that when it comes to **public comments**, anything being said is a question of fact, which could be difficult to determine. Some would argue that the police system in Singapore tends to be overcorrecting, and facts could be construed differently from its original intention to your detriment. Playing the devil's advocate, many people could indeed construe your comments as suggesting that you indeed 'attempted' to sow discord, which of course is not your intention. But by going public sometimes especially when it relates to something extremely emotional and personal, words can be misconstrued, which may pose a problem for your own protection. Going through such a hassle, I would *assume,* would not be in your best interest.

Nevertheless, I do think de-escalation is key now.",8,0,,,,lsct6w3

,Post,1g20hsm,We are making a new chess game,Agitated-Storage1922,2024-10-12 13:47:17+00:00,"It is called ColorNize and it is our hobby project. It is a turn-based strategic board game like chess but with a different mechanism. We are trying to make it more like an online game. The basic rules are done but we still need help to finish the game. If you are interested in strategic board games or game development, this could be an opportunity to do something together. 

The image shows our progress so far.


Our team currently has 4 people: I designed the game rules, one friend helped to test it, one coded it and another one handled the design. Unfortunately, two members are not in SG at the moment so we need more people to do their parts. It’s more convenient to be someone who’s also from NTU.

There are two things we need help with:

   1. Playtesting and improving the rules:

It took us over 2.5 years to reach the current rules and now we have to explore the tactical side of it. Although the basic rules can be explained in less than 1 minute, no one really knows how to play it well (even the creator himself).

Furthermore, we want to create new pieces (characters) with new special abilities. We also want to create some extra versions of the game’s rules to make it more fun. This will need a lot of playtests, so we can meet frequently to discuss.

It would be great if you have experience in some other strategic board games like Chess, Xiangqi, Go, Othello, etc to compare the complexity of our game to them. But even if you just want to make a creative game then feel free to join.

   2. Re-coding the game:

As the rules have been changing constantly, the current code is no longer suitable. And since we are also adding new pieces, we need someone to help us re-code everything. The prototype is currently on itch.io, coded using Godot. The code is very messy and long (1.5k lines) so you need to be familiar with Godot or any other programming language for game development. Can consider this as a practicing experience too.


DM me if you want to join. Don’t worry if you are busy this semester because the project is long-term and the schedule is super flexible (basically anytime we can meet, no deadlines).  

Even though we started this just for fun, now we also have intentions to market it once everything is done. If we succeed in making a profit, we will pay you back for the contributions.

I think its cool for marketing a game like that, i think if you are prioritising profits, usually super competitive and complex games tend to retain or increase in player base, so it would have to be a really insightful idea that takes board games to a new level.

,Comment,1gfesg0,SOS: DFT in Complex Numbers Just Broke My Brain LINEAR ALGEBRA,alkalineHydroxide,2024-10-30 07:37:18+00:00,"So basically imaging a signal, could be a audio or anything else. In theory, you can break down this signal into a set of sine waves of different frequencies. 

The Fourier Transform normally brings us from the normal space into the frequency space. This allows us to see the frequencies of all those sine waves that make your original signal. The issue with it is that its a continous integral, which makes it hard to calculate sometimes.

Discrete Fourier Transform aims to solve this by discretizing the integral. You basically get to calculate the coefficients for individual frequencies (if you alr know that only a few frequencies are involved but not all the frequencies (of which most are going to have a coefficient of 0)

\[following is based on the discretization making frequencies whole numbers\]

Now why are there complex numbers? The DFT equation uses e\^(-2ipi/n) where n is a number up to the number of your sampled points on the original wave/signal. If you remember how complex numbers work, this is equal to cos(-2pi/n) +isin(-2pi/n). As angular frequency is 2pi\*f, when the 2pi/n is a multiple of that (ie 1/n=f), you get cos(-2pif)+isin(-2pif) (for eg) which will give you a +-1 + 0 meaning its a nonzero value and you get a hit if you have a value at that sample point. This will show up as a spike in your graph after you perform the fourier transform.

DFT fast tracks this by assuming the frequencies to test beforehand, which is why you have 1/n or some variant of that instead of the continuous t

Goal: Given x datapoints, decompose it to a sequence of cosine waves.   
  
A bit on the Fourier coefficients, X. A cosine wave can be written as m \* cos(fx + phase), f is some frequency, m is some magnitude. Remember the magical formula, sin(x+pi/2) = cos(x) from secondary school? It turns out theres this ""balancing act"" to do with sine and cosine, which describes the phase of some cosine function. Some phase shift => less/more contribution from sin/cos to some magnitude. Best way to look at this is a unit circle! Annnd as it turns out, this has a good mapping to the idea of complex numbers, which is why each element of X is complex!

Now the crazy confusing, just dc how it works, just memorise part, the analysis matrix, W. High level idea:  
\- Each row k of W describes how well fit frequency k fit the datapoints, x.   
\- Each col n of W describes how well fit each frequency k fit the datapoints, x.   
You can think of this analysis matrix going from row k -> k+1 as jumping to analyse the next frequency for all datapoints.   
The prof gave this ""shortcut"" as to how to construct the analysis matrix. This idea makes a bit more sense if we think of it as going from row -> row, and within each row, go from column to column as a kind of rotation of 2pi \* nk / N.   
  
Good to knows:  
\- W is symmetric!  
\- W is orthogonal, so WT = W, WH => just multiply -1 to each exponent in W. Useful for IDFT.   
\- IDFT is the inverse, finding the datapoints x given the Fourier coefficients, X. Becareful, we need to multiply by 1/N. Notice how multiplying Wx is like adding a linear combination of N terms (W is square, NxN)? Suppose one of the frequencies matches up exactly to our desired wave. Then we are adding say 1 + .... + 1 = N. We have this weird scaling to derive X. So we need to undo that by multiplying by 1/N to get back our original x.  

Tl;dr;   
\- x encodes datapoints, values we want to try to find a series of cosine functions to match.  
\- Each element of X encodes the magnitude and phase of some decomposed cosine function. When you add these cosine functions together, you can plug and chug and it should map to the datapoints you fed in.  
\- Just memorise the W matrix. LOL

Looming questions:  
\- Why do we only analyse f = 0...N-1? Why not f = 0...2N.... or even non discrete amounts? Why does it work? Does it require more datapoints to give a better match to the given x?  
\- Why would Fourier torture us?",2,0,,,,luhnzjp

- y4s1 LOA and intern, y4s2 fyp
- y4s1 fyp, y4s2 LOA and intern
- y4s1 fyp, grad in 3.5 and find FT job

for context I'm not in ABP and PI would be my first official/ paid intern. originally thought LOA and interning again would be the better choice to gain more exp before going for FT employment, but at the same time the allure of FT employment 6 months earlier (assuming that I can find) would be significantly more money. appreciate any input and help!",20,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1ga5mjp/grad_35yrs_or_loa_and_intern/,,,

I have decided to remove the very first post. I believe it no longer serve original purpose of advocating harmony and removal of violence speech in campus.
I have talked with moderator and thx him for his effort.

The pre-existing hatreds among population from some comments below are something that were not forseen, I think it buried the point and objective of that post. Again, xenophobic and racism isn't tolerable from my end. Empathy is the key thing here, no one should be under fear and threat. Which is what I felt when hearing comments.

Despite the removal, my ground still stand. Any form of advocating conflicts and military activities should not be acceptable in our NTU campus. The reason why I didn't choose to report or confront the people on the table is because i feel it is just some stupid gag and chats and it should not be punished out of proportionality. Whether I should keep this gesture of tolerance and hope for improvement in future are under self reflection, but most likely to be the same.

However, elephant is still in the room. From some comments in the original post, without doubt, the voices of supporting intrusive military operation is existing among NTU student population.

I always considered myself as cosmopolitan who choose the path of anti-militarism. A title of jornal artcle are always among one of my favourite phrases ""From Sword to Chrysanthemum"". People use competing ideas of liberty to bomb each other to rubbles, that my thoughts on collective war and conflict. Ideals of anti-militarism is dissipating in nowadays' global arena, ensure its survival and go what it's beyond would be the task i will keep in the next 20 years.

I will keep the update post on for next few days, as i think it content some essence of what I trying to say.

Now even new job postings are rare and I keep seeing the same few jobs now. 

Need some advice here, fellow grads and alumni- should I be looking at getting a masters to tide over while waiting for the economy to recover? Should I be moving overseas, and what countries do you recommend? 

Some background info about myself: 
- I did my internship and FYP in plant related fields. Not the most lucrative, I know, but I loved ecology and I was not able to get other internships.
- I can speak chinese and english equally well, and passable levels of french. 
- I don't mind if my salary never goes above 8k or if I don't get to be PI. Climbing the hierarchy or corporate ladder is not important to me. 
- However, I just BTOed with my boyfriend who is going overseas to work for a few years, so I can't be making starvation wages (my family is willing to help but I can't let them pay for me forever). 
- My working style is that I'll really spend a lot of time zooming into things if I'm truly interested and know why I need it done by a certain date (maybe due to my adhd). I have no problem working late or weekends as long as there is no micromanagement that I must arrive at 8am or something. But of course I will arrive if the experiment needs an entire day to finish and there's multiple people meeting to finish it. I quite liked the research process during my FYP. 

So, I've heard getting postgrad studies will close many doors for you if you keep going more and more niche. Should I be getting a masters from another discipline to branch out? Should I follow my passions even though I may end up jobless still? Should I continue the job search to gain some experience in the field, since singapore seems to value experience over education?

I studied under the American education system and had classmates who immediately made off to the US for university right after their two years of National Service (while I settled for NTU).  And in case you were wondering, they went to schools like USC (i.e., University of Southern California) to study Business, so it's not like they used daddy's money to study in some godforsaken institution in some off-the-map location.

Yet, even they couldn't find jobs after banging on so many companies' doors and sending out god-knows however many hundreds of applications.  Last I've heard, they're going back to grad. school - not to achieve a specific goal or to hone their focus in on a topic, but just to pass the time.  It's a horrible decision if you ask me, but hey - their money, their choices.

Grad. school is a double edged sword - it could help you open more doors, but going to grad. school because you can't find a job is a huge gamble and just asking for trouble in my opinion.  You could very well land yourself in a pretty frustrating limbo state where you're overqualified for entry-level jobs, but don't have the necessary experience for more senior positions (in spite of your paper qualifications).  I think you should only go into grad. school if you know *exactly* what it is that you want at the end of the degree and are willing to accept the risks and the costs of going to grad. school (i.e., things don't always pan out the way you want to sometimes).

>I'll really spend a lot of time zooming into things if I'm truly interested and know why I need it done by a certain date (maybe due to my adhd

I've been working for about four months now (i.e., before I even officially graduated), and sometimes - stuff just needs to be done. Stuff happens all the time in the workplace; I work in a dry lab and sometimes, I become the go-to person for media-related works (e.g., video editing for interview footage, making videos to show at board meetings, etc). I spent half of my Friday throwing together a video photo collage for an anniversary dinner in Canva after some seemingly minor comments that ultimately resulted in a massive overhaul of what I initially came up with on Monday.

Yeah, media isn't something I wake up for nor dream about, but it's not always about whether you're interested in something or not. You just need to get it done sometimes - don't forget that!

>Should I follow my passions even though I may end up jobless still?

Question is: do you have any other skills and / or interests outside of Ecology, and are you willing to explore other industries for job opportunities?

You've been job-hunting - presumably for Ecology-related jobs - for the past couple of months to no avail, money is probably somewhat of a priority for you because of that BTO flat, and things don't look as though they're going to improve quickly anytime soon. Nobody wants to work for peanuts - that's completely understandable, and while I don't know how your own finances or your family's are doing, you probably need money soon because of that flat lest it starts to *really* eat into your own or your family's financial resources.

Have you tried expanding your job search to other industries? Even when I was job hunting, I applied for and went to numerous interviews in other fields - software engineering, business management, business automation, and even more traditional research-based ones like the job I currently have. Sure, I might not have made the cut for that software engineering position I interviewed for, but I can't imagine I would've gone for eight interviews if I merely limited my options to one field or another. Plus, you've said it yourself - the job market sucks now: hence the reason why it's so important to also not be too picky if you can!

Otherwise, you might just have to settle for those ""starvation wages"" in the time being doing a part-time job while job-hunting on the side lines if you're really that intent on doing Ecology (assuming that things don't improve).",3,0,,,,lrozhvq

Exactly my fear there, which is why I decided to look for a job instead of applying to grad school immediately, not knowing the job market is getting worse, haha. 

>Question is: do you have any other skills and / or interests outside of Ecology, and are you willing to explore other industries for job opportunities?

Yep, I have been applying to other jobs (other bioscience fields, healthcare, government) as well, but it seems like I don't have the specific experience needed for many of them, which is a shame. If I were to expand outside of bioscience, I'm not that sure what industries I can expand into. It's a rather niche degree after all.

Feel like there is such a lack of practice available for the mod that I want to kill myself . I was told to use the Reference book Textbook to help gain more practice questions (but I feel like the questions available on that are sooo much more different compared to tut qns)

I am not even sure if I am studying correctly...haha. all I do is try to attempt tutorial and when I stuck on the questions , try to rewatch lecture just to get stick again LOL

I rmb for the exam I focused on scoring for the first two qns. I rmb qn 1 is basically CA1 with added complications that aren't too bad. Nth out of syllabus so pls try to score for that.

Qn 2 is based on one tutorial for the thermo portion so pls fully understand that tutorial also it rly isn't that bad.

For the fluid mech part all I can say is good luck ah. Basically I know I did well for CA1, and qn 1 and 2 for the exam and the CA2 and qn 3,4 of exam I just anyhow whack formula and pray I understood the figure correctly. I got A- for the mod. I wish u atb

If u need help with the thermo portion I'm available

Due to the dumb amount of trick questions in the first half I actually got pulled down by the first part, thermodynamics. The second part actually helped me score cuz I was more proficient and able to absorb classical physics concepts to tackle the fluid mechanics problems.

Second part looks hard but with enough practice and learning it is actually not as difficult as it looks. I'd advise not to give up on the second part. You need to be proficient in foundation physics for the rest of your life in NTU anyways. Pro tip is to practice more. Look at sample problems and tackle them in fluid mechanics textbooks, do problems that are beyond whats given in tutorial and lecture.

Well if practicing doesn't work, ask ChatGPT to walk you through all the concepts and give you a guide to solving the problem again. ChatGPT can do that much although it cannot solve numerical uni level problems.",2,0,,,,lucz0vc

I am currently working on my ML0004 assignment. As part of this project, I need to conduct informational interviews with career professionals. My goal is to gain insights and career advice from professionals in the tech industry, especially those related to Machine Learning,AI and Data Analytics.

If you have experience in any of these areas and would be willing to participate in a brief (5-10 minute) informational interview, I would be incredibly grateful for your insights. Your guidance would be invaluable for both my assignment and my career exploration. Please let me know a convenient time for you, and we can arrange the interview over Zoom or any platform that works best for you.

Thank you so much for considering my request. I truly appreciate your time and support!",16,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1fva8ha/ml0004_informational_interview/,,,

You can get an idea by looking at the course modules. (Although with that said, the knowledge is not something that you cannot already pick up on your own) After foundation year you choose the major you want to specialise in.

You study a little bit of everything. Go into this course if you want to have a broad based engineering education which is beneficial as a manager, but if you want to practice engineering, go for a traditional Engineering course as you will encounter issues with a BEngSci degree when registering for engineering practice at the professional level. It's certainly competitive as it has a low intake of about 236 last year, compared to others such as 650 for CBE, etc. For Renaissance Engineering they do look at 'O' Level physics for a pass.",1,0,,,,lpydblh

Coming from a poly background of not a science course, I’m struggling to understand the concepts and am lagging behind compared to JC students who have prior knowledge of some sort. On top of it, this DA is H2 math and I have stopped doing math since O level which is 5 years ago and my foundation was not even that great. Honestly, everything is very hard for me to catch up especially this DA course that requires more practice times and I haven’t been able to get myself to do it. Those who have experienced in having a 2nd major and struggled, or seniors who have dropped 2nd major, what would you tell your younger selves if they are in my shoes. I don’t really think that I want to stay in my primary major field forever and want to have a flexibility to switch fields if I ever want to in the future, should I carry on with this 2nd major? I know many have told me that this isn’t the only way and that I can take up online classes OTOT and my gpa won’t have to suffer. I really don’t know what to do. I know for sure, my primary major mods aren’t that great too and am having hard times catching up as well so honestly I should just stop holding onto too many things that I can’t manage and focus on what’s more important that is the primary major which I’ll be graduating with right?

2nd major really does not impact your employment - 30 AU is simply insufficient to compete with people who have dedicates their whole degree to the field. Employers won't pick you just because you have the 2nd major.

But, if you do plan to eventually move into DS, the 2nd major can provide you with the entry knowledge to delve further into the field on your own.

Also if you want to drop the 2nd major please drop it ASAP. I didn't drop my 2nd major back in Y1 and I'm regretting it. Dropping 2nd major at Y2 is kinda a waste since you will be more than halfway thru the 30 AU by then.",6,0,,,,lqgm9hf

,Post,1fuj9jc,Should I transfer or drop out from my current uni to switch to Humanities at NTU?,_ztxt_,2024-10-02 15:41:56+00:00,"I have always wanted to go to NUS/NTU, but I didn’t do well enough in poly to get in.

I am currently in my first year first semester of an ICT course in another local uni. A few weeks in and I dislike everything—from the content taught and the way the school teaches the material, to the attitudes of most of my other cohort mates. I can confidently say that I have lost interest in learning IT in an academic setting.

I was previously considering transferring over from my current uni to NTU, however that would mean I would need a perfect or close to perfect GPA, which is not only hard, but also something that has little room for error. I don’t want to permanently sabotage my chances of getting into NTU in the case my academic results are not as good as planned and leave a record of doing mediocrely in uni, so I was also considering the option of dropping out from my current uni.

If I drop out, it will save me a few months of time as I won’t have to continue wasting time studying something I have already lost interest in. I was thinking of using this time to prepare, sit for, and hopefully ace the SAT exam, then use those results to apply to NTU, a route I have read that others who didn’t do well in poly have taken, with some actually successfully gaining acceptance into NTU. I have taken the SAT before several years back and am confident that I can score reasonably well in a retake as my studying skills have improved since. Also, there is more flexibility with this path as I can just reschedule the exam if I don’t feel prepared enough for whatever reason.

However, I am concerned if having a record of dropping out from another university will affect my chances of getting into NTU. This is the only thing holding me back from withdrawing from my course now.

I would love to hear your opinions on whether I should transfer or drop out.

my past did not affect my application; not a single question in my interview was about my past uni or bad grades. the interviewer was more interested in my past research (e.g essays for IB) or my research interests relating to the major. 

my best advice now is to listen to your gut, and know that 1 ‘wasted’ semester is nothing compared to 4 years of hell. however, don’t drop out yet, make use of the LOAs that are free of charge so while you’re studying for SATs etc you have a back up place in your ICT course. 

from personal experience, i’ve been so so much happier studying humanities in ntu as compared to my previous major/ uni. i can say that transferring was one of the scariest but best decision of my life. in my previous major/ uni i was failing papers and struggling to stay entertained in class, but now in ntu i’m so passionate about what i’m studying that my grades are considered conventionally high. feel free to dm me about the transfer process, all the best!",9,0,,,,lq3e9jn

If it's just for the prestige or because NUS/NTU are renowned. I'm just gonna be honest with you. It's not important at all. Some local companies might prefer these universities, but it's not gonna be the biggest factor. The education quality is not all it's cracked up to be. A lot of people who have been to nus or ntu can attest to this. A friend told me to avoid nus, so I came to ntu, but it's just as bad. If it's the social life, I think I kinda get it, but how valuable is that for you?

You'll probably want to get a better idea of how teaching is conducted for the course you're interested in and how people are like in that course. I'm not sure how different ntu's student base will be from yours, but I thought it'd be similar in most places. There are people who just want to graduate, some that are very competitive academically and some that are like crazy successful in the working world alr. You can find them if you get to know more people.

Lastly, I think they'll probably note down the empty period, but it won't be a big thing or even negative at all. The worst case is during the interview (if there is one), they ask you for the reason, and I think you'll be able to justify it easily.",4,0,,,,lq64xrn
,Comment,1fuj9jc,Should I transfer or drop out from my current uni to switch to Humanities at NTU?,LoudIndependence7274,2024-10-03 10:16:40+00:00,"Hello there young man/woman, 

When I read your post, I'm concerned. You're talking a lot about losing your chance to get to NTU or making it there but doing badly there, etc.

I think you're asking yourself the wrong question. You're in an ICT course now, and you wish to switch to Humanities at NTU. The question should be: do you want to do ICT or Humanities (regardless of school)? You say you don't enjoy your current ICT course. But could it be that the course at this school sucks, rather than you hating ICT in general? You said you came from poly -- did you do an ICT course then? Did you enjoy it then?

These two paths are very, very different. I can't speak for ICT, but being an ex-NUS FASS graduate, I can tell you what humanities is like: a lot, a lot, a lot of reading, essay writing, research. Is that up your alley? 

Next, consider your future prospects. You will have high employability with an ICT qualification. As compared to those with specialised degrees, Humanities graduates find it harder to get a job after graduation, and when they do, they are paid lower than graduates with specialised degrees. Take it from me, I'm 40 years old now and I've been through my share of job changes and interviews and life.

This being said, my friend, I also don't mean you should continue studying something that makes you miserable. I've also been there, done that. But I do think that you need to think about your skills and talents and to find your ikigai: that sweet spot between what you're good at, what you like to do, and what the world needs that they will pay you for. 

You can try doing some career and personality tests for clarity. I don't think the question should be school X or school Y, but instead, what you think you reasonably like and are good at. Ask your best friends and family also: ""If you could see me in a job, what job would that be?""

Here's some useful resources:

Until this year you would’ve been able to carry forward your coursework marks, but not anymore with the new policy change so you’ve to re-do all the coursework again. 

Before you decide, go read up on what that mod is a pre-requisite for, and whether this will delay your graduation. You might be able to take it concurrently with another mod that it is a prerequisite for, but dependent on school approval so not guaranteed. 

^one way to bypass this is to go on exchange, you can take mods that you haven’t cleared the pre-requisite for. Anyways think it through carefully, there’s still 3 weeks or so, enough time to catch-up.",30,0,,,,lu4z729

1. How to apply for hall application for sem 2? Are there any forms to fill up online or hardcopy forms to submit? I didn't apply for hall for sem 1 bsce I thought I can tahan the long journey (in travel for 1.5h to get to school = 3h of travelling each day??!!) What a delulu person I was. I have 5 hall points from my cca but I dont have a hall rn so ig it doesn't rrly matter if I apply for hall?? I wrote to OCH but they said to apply in early Nov, but they didn't say where or exactly when?? And also when I checked the hall application website, it doesn't rlly say anywhere?

2. I heard that successful hall applications for sem 2 has very low rates? Is that true? If yes, then what hall type should I apply for if I want to increase my chances? Is there a ranking/order I should follow when applying lol (e.g. double no-aircon>single no-aircon>double aircon>single aircon??). I don't really have a dealbreaker, but actually I would love a single room (idc with or without aircon), but hey, beggers cannot be choosers.

3. If I get a hall, what activities should I join in order to guarentee my stay in hall (don't need that particular room; I'm ok with moving) for all 4 years? (Ofc I recognise that I should join hall activities to have fun, but I'm focusing more on the 'survivial' side of things here) Hall comm (like officers level)? How hard is it to get those positions (even if u have other leadership experience) & what's the commitement level like for these positions?

I was previously under WSDeg program but dropped out before block 3. The program is pretty chill. Y2 summer and Y3 PI are with the company. No additional stuff during the semester, except in year 4 where you work 1 day a week. That one day is for you to do your fyp research so there’s no additional workload unless the company gets you to do extra work. Whether you like it depends on the company.

It uses up your BDE AUs and you need to have sufficient before you can apply. There’s no effect on curriculum plan.

- CAO gives acceptance, then apply to host uni

Lesson learnt:
- technical skills, tho ngl not too much. Fortunately I was able to try new things that I found fun.

It was unfortunately not considered by the administration as they thought it was codependent with red and duplicating demand, so it was either: do red loop or do purple loop. It was supposed to have replaced then red and blue EXPRESS which were removed without replacement. Buses went to do normal route.

After 3 years in NTU, I've formed a telegram community in ""/NTUCampusRider"" that's interested in making the campus rider situation better with one last go at making a way better proposal (not just another purple loop) during our last AY with NTU.

However, we are currently unsure about the extent of the support so hence we are polling on reddit:

Do y'all think that the current campus red and blue needs a rework?

Like, say red loops around the previously-proposed purple loop route and blue plies the crespion/H1/H2/H6 area?


I feel like this might help the situation since (anecdotally speaking) most people are just opposed to walking under the sun and so rely on the bus to get from hall to school, whereas shuttling people to TCT so that they can walk under shelter to NS/SS seems like it should reduce the burden on the internal transport system two-fold by firstly shortening the overall bus route (so people reach their destinations faster) and by reducing the burden on the internal transport system (by shifting some portion of the commute burden to the individual).",13,0,,,,lsjacxm

My prof told us that in one of his previous classes, one of his ex-students is on the verge of failing cos she didn't bother to do any assignments, etc etc. He even attempted to reach out to her to find a solution but in the end kena ghosted.

Most of the seats go to JC kids that's why. i wouldn't say that coming to wkw after mcm is useless, even though that's a very popular line of thought. It all depends on the modules you choose to do after your first sem (the sem when all your classes are decided for you). yes some of the foundational mods have repeated content, but there's so much more to explore in comms that a 3 year ""buffet of comms"" diploma dos not have time to cover, and especially not at the depth that you can go into in this degree programme.  


obviously if you just choose all the mods that sound like what you did in poly then maybe you wont learn completely new things all the time, but in general there's plenty of new things to learn. Of course there's also nothing wrong with changing things up and getting a bizz degree or something else, it all depends on what you want out of uni  
  
 I've heard many stories where mcm grads had to relearn how to write a press release (yes, even something as simple as that) in wkw HAHA and we all obviously had a good enough gpa to get in so it's not like we weren't paying attention in mcm HAHA.

- So is it tough for CvE student to switch career to Finance/Bank, other engineerings or IT ?


- Cuz CvE doesn't really teach high tech skills, can CvE undergraduate still self-learn programming or other skills and get some well-paid tech or finance jobs?

,Post,1g6a5gj,"Took FEM Course This Semester, and Now I’m Drowning... Should I Ask for Help or Just Drop It?",Still-Ad-7227,2024-10-18 04:40:22+00:00,"So, this semester I made a strategic (or so I thought) decision to take a 7-series course on Finite Element Methods (FEM). The setup seemed perfect—two take-home assignments that make up 100% of the grade. Seemed like a low-effort, high-reward course, right? 🤷‍♂️

I attended the first 2-3 lectures, and let me tell you, it was like someone bowled a bouncer straight over my head. Zero comprehension. Everything felt *too* advanced, and before I knew it, I just...stopped going. Figured I’d wing it on the assignments and cruise through.

Fast forward to now—I’ve taken a look at the assignments, and wow. Just *wow*. They’re on a whole different level, way beyond what I can handle with the minimal understanding I have from those few lectures.

The problem? Everyone else in this course is a PhD student and seems to be following along just fine. Meanwhile, I’m here contemplating my life choices. 😅

I see two options ahead:

1. **Read the course material** (somehow) and approach the prof for help. But here’s the thing: do professors actually help if you go to them outside of class? I’ve never done that before. Like, can I go knock on their door and ask them to walk me through what I’ve missed?
2. **Drop the course**. But, how does that affect my PhD? Am I going to be handed some terrible grade if I drop this late into the semester? Will it look bad on my transcript or impact future opportunities?

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Should I power through and hope the prof can guide me? Or is it smarter to cut my losses and focus on something I can actually handle? I’m seriously stuck here and could use some advice!",8,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1g6a5gj/took_fem_course_this_semester_and_now_im_drowning/,,,

Startup role is software developer working on their in-house software mainly to collect data from sensors, with some frontend and backend. Role seems quite flexible and I may be able to explore interests. $1500 stipend.

MNC role is video analyst working on improving object detection algorithms for cameras used in high security locations. $2000 stipend. Was offered a position the same day as the interview even though I felt I didn’t do well. The interviewer told me that not many people applied for the video analyst role so I think that’s why I got it.

Both positions are something that I have interest in and don’t mind doing for PI. Startup one may be more relevant to the industry I might pursue although I am not set on that path yet.

However, I will likely be pursuing a SWE role in the future so I am unsure if a video analyst intern might be a disadvantage. Reason I am still considering it is because it sounds interesting, pay is higher, and office is closer to home. I may be able to make it sound like a Computer Vision software engineering internship in my resume, since the role does involve CV and machine learning. I don’t know if it would hold the same weight as an actual SWE internship though.

,Post,1gdj7lw,Need help deciding- NTU CS vs SUTD CS (SHARP),WaferCrazy2821,2024-10-27 19:34:17+00:00,"Hi. I'm a prospective undergraduate who's gonna start university in 2025 (currently serving NS). I want to study computer science and currently hold two offers: 1. NTU computer science. 2. SUTD Honours and Research programme (SHARP)

Initially, I was always leaning towards NTU computer science (given all the hype about its ranking and prestige) and had just applied to SUTD's SHARP because it seemed interesting.

However, after getting accepted to SUTD's SHARP and after researching more on NTU's computer science programme online, I read alot of negative comments on various subreddits, about how NTU's CS isn't as good anymore, and students seem to be complaining about a lot of things (saying things like the curriculum is outdated, the professors don't teach properly and etc). On the other hand, I'm reluctant to pick SUTD because its quite new and hasn't made that big of name for itself (yet). This got me thinking again and now I'm stuck deciding between the two offers.

(A little context about SUTD's SHARP: Its a research-intensive programme where, along with your regular SUTD degree, you learn research skills and work on your research, go for internships at research institutions, etc. You get S$7.5k in research stipends and S$7.5k in grants in conference travel, publication charges and other research-related expenses, and if selected, you may continue your degree via 2 additional terms to get a Master of Engineering (MEng) degree)

A little more about myself: I want to get into a good graduate school so I can pursue a masters degree (or maybe an MBA), and therefore, I want my undergrad to give me opportunities to build a great profile. (Ofc I want a high-paying job in the tech too, I would be lying if I stated otherwise)

Anyway the things I want to enquire are:

1. What exactly is the issue with NTU's computer science programme and is it actually as bad as people make it sound?
2. Is SUTD's SHARP really worth it? Will I still be able to land a good grad school for masters, or does the reputation of your undergraduate university really matter that much?
3. How do the two computer science programmes fair against each other?
4. Do you have any regrets picking NTU (CS)/SUTD (CSD)?
5. Please do feel free to leave any other feedback or advice

Thanks!

P.S. I'm posting this on r/NTU and r/sutd too, to gain more insights from people currently undertaking these programs (in case you're wondering).",6,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1gdj7lw/need_help_deciding_ntu_cs_vs_sutd_cs_sharp/,,,

\> What exactly is the issue with NTU's computer science programme and is it actually as bad as people make it sound?  
The general consensus was, the course content covered was 'outdated', and in some ways, too focused on the theoretical side of things. It isn't as rigourous!11!!!!

However, theres a misconception of what a ""CS degree"" is trying to provide. Most have the false perception that it is all about SWE. The whole point of it is to teach you how to think rather than give you a concrete pathway to become a certain type of engineer.

So it's more productive to ask, what tools does NTU provide to let you think? Personally, I would say, yes. Profs generally try to provide differing perspectives in synchronous lecture vs the LAMS (Pre-recorded lectures, asynchronous). You are encouraged to do tutorials, the questions vary in difficulty and require some perspectives to tackle them. Sometimes, you get that ""Aha!"" moment, and feel like you are high on drugs. 

\> Do you have any regrets picking NTU (CS)/SUTD (CSD)?  
Everyones experiences are highly variable! Whatever you do, you are bound to have regrets so I will not sugar coat it and say NTU CS is perfect. 

There will be profs/TAs who are clearly there because they have an obligation to do so. But there are also profs who are there who you can tell that they are really trying. 

The course content can be very theory based. Concepts covered can be very abstract, and they try to link it up in some application. But the explanations profs tend to provide may sometimes be unsatisfactory to you because they have some other perspective that you may not have. So you have to be resourceful and learn to learn. :)   
  
But... I am confident that these issues aren't solely to do with NTU. Any university you go to, there will be such variability in experiences.   


Other things I wanted to mention,  
\- In NTU, generally speaking, unless you have experience in that particular course, you will not be able to understand EVERYTHING. Don't shrive for perfection, shrive for ""good enough"".  
\- Wherever you go, try to understand the intent of what you are doing. Your mindset is everything. Even the most useless courses (AHEM ICC MODULES), you will come to tolerate them. For example, CC5, healthy living and wellbeing. Seemingly useless, but their intent is for to give you an opportunity to improve yourself by making you accountable for 3 AUs.  
\- There have been some changes to NTU CS and a lot of the complaints were before these changes were made.",10,0,,,,lu3tpbr

1)NTU CS cohort size is really huge. SUTD’s smaller cohort size allows better teaching.  The outdated content taught at NTU is not the problem because you can learn more outside of school. My experience up till now in year 2 is that most CS professors and TA don’t really care about teaching or engaging with students compared to other schools in NTU. I think the cause of this is because there’s just too many students compared to teachers.

2)If you want to get into a research postgrad then research experience is basically a must. The research scholarship trumps NTU here no doubt. You can still do research in NTU but you have to work extra hard vs being guaranteed and paid a good sum for doing research at SUTD. Reputation of your referees matter more than which school you are from.

case by case basis because there is a quota for the number of international students that can get tuition grant. afaik its easier to get into uni without tuition grant as international student, and since u already went through that route, it will be much tougher to get it now as u will be subjected under the quota they set.

Don’t feel any compatibility issues on my m2 mac pro using it for software development. Get the m3 air. Can’t ever go back to windows after experiencing m chip latops. Light weight, fan-less (no noise during lessons and barely any heat) and long battery life. Its powerful and I appreciate having been able to place a laptop on my lap in the train without being burnt.

If you have many ml subjects like for data science and analytics. You should consider getting the pro for speedier training and inference. It can’t compete with a discrete gpu but for school projects it gets the job done.

Personally never used surface 11 pro but know of others who had it and its battery life is measly + it heats up quickly. And their chip probably isn’t as well-made as apple’s. 

If you plan to get a tablet, get the ipad air. The apple pencil 2 is miles ahead of the 1st version. Plus you can use it as a portable second monitor",0,0,,,,ltb3xjm

Prof GGY's archaeology mod (HH1125) only has quizzes which were super easy 2 years ago

I don't think Prof KKW's mods have exams; HH3039 Maritime Asia in the Longue Duree was quite fun for me. Final paper had no word count so I could submit an almost 7K word essay LOL

Dr Lin's mods are pretty easy too, and I don't remember there being exams. He used to have lots of strange little extra credit stuff too so it was easy to score

For those WITH exams: I think Prof Park likes to have final exams in his mods (idk, I haven't done a Prof Park mod before but that's what I've heard). HH2005 also has exams. Prof MSB's Biopolitics had a midterm exam but no final exam.

i’ve emailed NTU housing and the reply i got was 

“Please note that the housing applications are not processed on a first-come, first-served basis. The allocation of hall and room will be done by balloting with priority given to incoming graduate students on research programmes who have not domiciled in Singapore before.
 
As on-campus housing for graduate students are limited, submitting an application does not guarantee a hall place. Hence, all applicants are strongly advised to concurrently make plans for alternative housing. This is to ensure that they have readily available options for consideration, should the housing application be unsuccessful.”

can anyone who has been through this or knows how housing allocation works in NTU help answer please 😭 i’m a local singaporean but lives literally 2 hours away (east of sg) from ntu so i rly need to secure campus accoms :(

,Post,1g17qtj,Questions about NBS risk analytics spec,SpecialistNew5356,2024-10-11 11:40:41+00:00,"Hi guys! I am a prospective student matriculating next year studying ACBS.

From what I’m aware about most students studying acbs would choose to take BnF as their business spec because it intertwines the most with accountancy and exposes you to most of the business functions in banking. 

However, I’ve been thinking about my career path in the future and I decided I would like to dabble in the more mathy side of finance (but not quant level that kind). Hence I decided that I would prefer to spec in risk analytics instead.

I’ve been trying to find more information about the risk analytics spec especially for acbs students but since it seems to be a relatively new spec a few years ago I can’t seem to find much info. 

I would like to ask a few qns if possible!

1. How is the workload for the spec? I understand that accounting is a very content heavy subject and I’m unsure if taking this spec would make it tough to cope?

2. How deep is the content in the risk analytics spec? Is there enough modules to give one a good theoretical foundation, assuming I would want to pursue a masters in financial engineering or related in the future?

3. How are the club/internship opportunities for this spec? 

4. What is the presentation vs textbook exams ratio for this spec compared to others like bnf?

5. How would actuarial science compare? I understand that actuarial sci is a completely different industry from accounting but if anyone knows I’d love to know more!

6. Lastly, would it even be advisable to study acbs as compare to math sci or econs instead, and trying to pick up finance stuff on the side as compared to this spec?

I screwed up my Quiz 1 (~75%) and I missed 2 weeks of the e-learning component- that is 10.12% off aldy. Additionally, based on how my group project is going, my group project marks aren't likely to be great.

I'm hoping to get full marks for quiz 2 (which is delusional, I know), hence, given that I full mark it, I can expect to get 79-85% for stats. My first question is, is that enough for an A- based on your experience? As I really want the actuarial science specialisation.

My second question is, is there any way aside from grades in stats, financial management and accounting to secure chances of ACS, such as via appealing? My understanding in stats all lies in mathematics and geometry (CIE A level FM), and I have 0 familiarity in the way NBS just turns all of it to english and basic R, would that help my appeal?

tldr: is 85% enough for an A-, and is there a way aside from grades to attain ACS specialisation?

2. Document your thought process. Could be how you derive your algorithm, what optimisations you have made to it to improve it's efficacy (To make team formation more balanced). Treat the reader as a monkey who knows nothing. Let someone who knows nothing about your approach proofread it even.

3. Document your justifications. Could be why not all teams can be considered ""fairly balanced"" by your definition. 

The underlying goal of this project seems to be giving you a playground to think through a problem. After all, the course title is called ""Introduction to Computational Thinking"". So document it! :)",3,0,,,,lub7hzd

 You have no real control over what hall you get unless you have a medical exception that necessitates an AC room. You can also request a single room,  but this is not guaranteed at all.
 I'm in Tamarind which is supposed to be one of the more monkey prone halls, although I've had no encounters at the halls (although I did see a mother and child at archery one day, they're definitely still around).

>I feel like it's hard to discuss right and wrong here; it's obviously wrong to fail to restrain speech and behavior in public, **but it's also wrong to eavesdrop on people and move private conversations into the open**. Political stance aside, the point of contention in this post is not just a simple issue of free speech, but more in the misunderstanding of the stance and the lack of dialog. The dichotomy between the two positions can be clearly felt on different social media outlets.


Bruh if they talk until ppl sitting near by can hear them, is it ""eavesdropping"" at this point? is this china's version of enlighten centralism?

I am currently working on my profile , and my goal is to score 98 around in class 12 so that I get into these schools for computer science. 

However I think my Class 10 marks are not as good as they should be for majors like CS . So is there any need to compensate it ? By giving SAT or APs and getting a high score there .
Also do class 10 marks matter a lot in admissions.  Will be admission be in risk cause of that ? 

Also what all can I do to enhance my profile .
Currently I am focusing on studies only and trying to do some edx or coursera online courses side by side .

Chinese students on campus stay within own enclaves. infiltrate their WeChat groups, join NTU Chinese society to try to get to know them.

are you open to move to china cus most of Chinese students plan to return after they are done studying,or u have to find a girl that's willing to stay here.

I only have 1 China friend from NTU but he's essentially localised since he stayed here since he was a young kid.

Honestly, my Chinese is pretty conversational nothing too bad or too good.

I was previously talking to a Chinese girl (LDR) and I had a really good impression of her (besides her being a lil too ""female-empowered, dominant/narcissistic (?)"" and patriotic) other than that, I really liked her a lot. She's really career-driven, independent, eloquent, and smart. None of that princess syndrome that many SG girls have.

All I know is that they can be very realistic and practical, especially about ur job, money, intelligence and the family/parents have to really like you etc.

your Chinese will need work to increase your chances of having a closer relationship with the Chinese folks. might also explain why you didn't think Chinese girls have princess syndrome (maybe Ur Chinese isn't good enough for them to take advantage of you 🤣,it's ok, filters them out anyways but also decreasing the pool of girls you meet.)

be cautious tho, the girl from your previous LDR sounds like a gem and you are projecting her on the other Chinese girls. 

there's a TCM BDE on campus taught in Chinese, so I expect many Chinese folks to be there too can try taking it if you still need take BDE

u think they would value this ""freedom"" over the convenience and familiarity of their family resources at home? not unless they kena 铁拳ed even then I doubt many will wake up.

 it's incredibly hard to change someone's world view and values especially when they are taught from young. why are singaporeans having problems with our new pr and citizens from china and other countries? one reason is cus they are not embracing our values and integrating themselves into our society.
