Could've turned opinion around with a sincere apology and  showing that he put in the work since to learn from this incident.

We've all done stupid shit when we were young, could've gotten away with ""It was a youthful indiscretion but I learnt and am very sorry now that I know better"". I think most people can accept that and move on.

The term 'might' is used as an LOD is not a court case yet and might not even turn into 1 if the sender dropped it or what. 
But the post in the linkedin do felt like defamation in my opinion. ""Predator', 'Assault'and 'Sexually harrassed' are terms I think you use when the culprit is charged and accused of some criminal acts or disgusting acts that relate to such terms. Yes, tricking someone into drinking more alcohol is downright disgusting and from how this POS apology look like we can also tell he is a POS, but still dont have any proof or evidence of assault/harrassed. This might also be why NTU is not making a stance since not enough info/evidence to work on it?

Claim:
Ethan Ong, a member of the Students' Union, fed his victim a large quantity of alcohol in a bid to get a romantic confession out of them.

(The post also purposefully missed to mention that it's a group setting of 6 people, and there wasn't a moment where Ethan and victim were alone with each other, a condition necessary for him if he intended to sexually harass her.)

Truth:
http://soapbox.sg/2023/09/24/disgraced-former-ntusu-vice-president-out-of-union-presidential-bid-new-candidate-emerges/

The drinking session was held on Oct 15, 2022 in Ethan‚Äôs Hall of Residence room after a union committee meeting, according to Xinruo. She said a total of six union members attended, including her, Ethan, then-NTUSU president, then-NTUSU chief of staff and two other union Exco members. 

It also noted that a complaint, which was filed in September, did not report any form of sexual misconduct and the investigation also did not find any sexual misconduct as alleged in some social media posts. ‚ÄúThe university is concerned by some comments posted online and urges online users to refrain from making speculative and unsubstantiated allegations,‚Äù said NTU.

Stop all communications with the person, and whoever is related to this person who sent the letter. All communications now goes through respective lawyers only. Screenshot all messages that can be use as evidence. Any recording that identifies the person committing the offence, but does not reveal their NRIC, address, and other sensitive personal information, share with the lawyer. Lastly, stop posting or sharing information on all platforms within the social media space until this is sorted out. The lawyer can advice when and what can be shared.

LinkedIn poster here quite clearly states her intention to disrupt his job opportunities, something she shouldn't have a stake in to begin with. Doesn't quite help that she called it an assault and says he would 'have access to more potential victims' (in the future) in relation to sexual assault. That's an uphill battle for her to prove that it's true. 

This is why I feel the movement is quite derailed when people start insinuating or straight up saying he committed SA. He did an objectively bad thing, am very glad he's not representing us now but exaggerating the case when spreading it around is defamation.",17,0,,2023,9

Yet again, the speaker of Parliament has resigned, over a scandal which the PM knew about for years but did not disclose.

That's what LHY said. No mention of corruption or preferential treatment towards the ministers. SLA paying for renovations are true, because they are supposed to maintain the houses. The Ministers did also pay for their own renovations as well, but it does not make the previous statement false. Shanmugam is indeed the minister that directly oversees SLA, so that checks out. Trees were felled too. None of what Shan accused LHY of saying is here, none of what LHY said is untrue also.

he is guilty of nothing, despite you trying to to couch it in ""legalistic"" jargon. Hello, how can one be guilty when there is no law in the books for the crime you are talking about? There was no contact whatsoever and no outrage of modesty, indecent comments etc. 

You are simply profiling him - like a woman who allege a guy is sexually harassing her because he look in her direction for too long, and so happens his eyes are in the direction of her boobs.  

If what Ethan did can be charged as sexual crime, then a burglar who force his way into a young woman home at night can be given the additional charge of potential rape/molest/outrage of modesty simply because it contains the element of young woman, alone and force into her home at night which might be similar situation where such forceful sex crime occurred. Then we can also automatically assume they have the intention to rape but copped out at the last minute, because think of all the women sleeping at home at night. 

That is why Ethan is suing to clear his name of this mischaracterization, to let it be publicly known - disprove rumor mongers and cancellers. Ethan did the right thing to clear his name",4,0,,2023,9

And that lawsuit holds no basis. For a defamatory lawsuit to work, it must fulfill all of the following conditions where:

* The statement in question should be libellous or defamatory;
* The victim is the clear target of defamation or libel; and
* The statement must be published or be in public circulation. A third party must also be aware of it.

The last two conditions are fulfilled as accordingly, although the first condition can be construed to be defamatory since it does injure the victim‚Äôs reputation. That said, the valid defense for any of these arguments would render his entire lawsuit invalid:

* The statement was based on fact;
* The statement is objective and unbiased; or
* The statement is within public interest.

Defamation is a civil offense under Singaporean law. The consequences for defamation can include a court-ordered apology, damages to be paid to the defamed person, and an injunction to remove the false statement from social media.

Additionally, if the false accusation on social media leads to harm or incites hatred or violence against person B, person A could potentially face criminal charges such as harassment or incitement.‚Äù

This is if person B didn‚Äôt do the crime. In fact, he did. So if she has the victim and other witnesses on her side, ethan ong cannot do anything

Need to ask you if you received anything from the courts. If something has been filed through OS or writ, then it must be served on you for you to be notified.

If its just merely a lawyers letter, you can basically ignore their demands, because its basically just that, a letter of demand, to settle outside of courts. You only need to start worrying about courts and attendances and processes if an action has been filed with the courts. During my short stint at a law firm and during PT I sent out very outrageous letters of demands as a scare tactic all the time, which grounds and claims were mostly baseless. (wasn't a very good small firm). I would still write back to categorically dispute their claims at least as a record ans to show you aren't some gullible fool. Did they even threaten to commence civil action if you did not acceed to their demands?

You can read more about Letter of Demands here: https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/letters-of-demand-and-their-usages-in-singapore/

Mostly importantly: ""An LOD is usually sent to **warn the recipient of the claimant‚Äôs intention to commence legal action unless payment is made.** Doing so may potentially save huge costs by avoiding litigation if the recipient complies.

Additionally, an LOD is sometimes used as evidence in court, as proof of the claimant‚Äôs attempt to settle the matter.""",28,0,,2023,9

Don‚Äôt mind me I‚Äôm a passer by and have heard a lot through an NTU mate of mine.. im currently in my 2nd year of doing a JD, I‚Äôm sorry to hear the distress you are facing after realising this Ethan Ong was genuinely suing you. I must say that he truly believes he is untouchable, not to mention this ‚Äò‚Äômove‚Äù clearly shows just how entitled he is as well.. it is a move to Instill fear, and scare not only you but anyone who‚Äôd try to do something similar .. genuinely conniving as if he were truly apologetic as was the words ‚Äúsorry‚Äù was used in a headline on Today, he would not be making such bold moves. (An opinion anyway). 

First of all you should just deal with this from a place of confidence. Showing distress and being affected emotionally or mentally is precisely his goal. Try not to unwaver as he is just posturing. I‚Äôm sure you can research the precedent in Singapore and make your case, the only issue you need to worry about is $ to support your case and hire a practitioner. Trust me you‚Äôre going to be amazed at the amount of support you will receive financially when you open a go fund me and tell your story. 

Remember that you do not need to do anything unless he issues proceedings in court first. He can just as well issue you empty threats, a very strong possibility if you asked me. Both of you would just be wasting $ you think you have, but at the end of the day your defence is very strong as a lot have pointed out. Your post was well written and sparked real questions that needed to be answered, honestly raising this whole thing in court could even be a good thing. The questions would be answered, his reputation would be tarnished even more bc more people would read about it. It is a double-edged sword so trust me when I say it could be bullshit and he‚Äôs not actually intending to take you to court. 

If he is then you will appreciate the truth to your reasonable inquiries, and you can be proud of yourself for always asking questions that should be asked. 

You can also take solace in the fact that he clearly knows that his case is weak or at the very least, thin. If it was a clear defamatory case that he was confident about, the best and most effective recourse would be to alert the police in Singapore for a charge of criminal defamation. The fact that he went through a law firm and is wanting the case to be civil speaks volumes. Standard of proof etc. he‚Äôs got nothing and you should not worry, garner support and don‚Äôt be afraid",25,0,,2023,9

You mentioned this in your post:

> 54$ of respondents said they'd been sexually harassed by a colleague or superior. Imagine how many more potential victims he will have access to?

You said this after having made a comment along the lines ""this guy has stellar academic achievements and will no doubt secure a great job"".

The fact of the matter is that what he did doesn't amount to sexual harassment in the slightest. This is just indisputable. I only found out about this Ethan Ong incident from your LinkedIn post, and I took away the impression that this person actually got another person drunk to try and sexually assault them. I looked a bit deeper into the matter and this wasn't the case at all.

He intentionally gave the victim more alcohol against her stated wishes when she was already in a highly intoxicated state. This resulted in her throwing up and passing out, so harm was done. 

Assault doesn't always involve direct physical violence. Words alone can also be considered assault. 

https://singaporelegaladvice.com/law-articles/penalties-assaulting-person-singapore/

There's a section that gives an example of how if you do something that causes physical harm to another person indirectly, i.e. pouring boiling water into their bath water and it scalds them, it is assault.

The point of contention is intent, which is likely why his statement of apology says no malice intended. However, it is unlikely that he did not know the effects of giving someone drunk even more alcohol. The inappropriate questions asked (if true), which the girl was unlikely to have answered while sober, may also show intent.

Again, not a lawyer, but it does appear the incident could be interpreted as assault.",15,0,,2023,9

It's unfortunate that Ethan was actually petty enough to resort to hiring a lawyer over a case that he himself caused. What he is doing right now is pretty much bullying the weak with his fat wallet.

For now, just focus for your midterms. Try not to stress about it too much. You can rely on your friends and family for emotional support. After it's over, consult with your professors on what to do (since you're a law student). I'm sure they have more experience on what to do regarding such cases. Most likely you'll need a lawyer to back you up. In that case, you'll most likely need money. Set up a fundraiser and try to get money from there. If you're lucky, maybe there will be a lawyer who is willing to help you out for free.

430,Comment,16ub8fs,Ethan Ong Lawsuit,Unknown,2023-09-29 03:46:14+00:00,"According to the article you provided, words alone do not amount to assault. The words must accompany an action, that would cause the victim to fear for her safety and think that the perpetrator seeks to harm her. Of course, the action does not even need to have physical contact with the victim, just a gesture that makes the victim think the perpetrator is going to harm her.

It's very clear that ""assault"" must lead the victim to fear for her physical safety. In Ethan's case, the victim was unaware of her physical vulnerability due to her drunken state, so she was incapable of feeling alarmed or fearing for her own safety. Furthermore, Ethan did not actually do anything to physically harm her. 

If Ethan did actually cause harm to the victim after intoxicating her, then sure, the act of intoxication will be an aggravating factor in the sentencing.

Edit: Upon further research, I think there might be a prosecutable offense of Mischief in this case, because Ethan intentionally fed the victim a substance without her knowledge. However I doubt this act can legally be construed as Assault.",4,0,,2023,9

Not a lawyer either, but this doesn‚Äôt seem to hold water. By your logic, any intoxicated or demented or mentally incapacitated person can NEVER be assaulted because they don‚Äôt have the capacity to fear for their physical safety. That just seems‚Ä¶ odd and implausible.

The section where the example was given where a person pours boiling water into the bath water of another, causing them physical harm has its parallels. The person bathing would not have been aware of the threat or feared for their physical safety when bathing, but harm would've been done.

To have given her more alcohol when she was already in a state of intoxication and asking for water, leading to her throwing up and passing out, is harm. Whether it has long lasting effects is immaterial, her body could not take the amount of alcohol he was feeding her at that point.

That said, if an actual lawyer could weigh in, would be happy to have this cleared up.",3,0,,2023,9

Also there is no criminal force used in this case because Ethan did not make any physical motion that would cause the alcohol to go down the victim's throat without her consent.

However, I do think there is a crime being committed here.

2. NTU gave him the lightest punishment possible to man (oop mentioned 3 month suspension, but ntusu said it's a 5 week suspension from union activities? Dawg that's even worse), and gaslit and victim-blamed, acting as if reporting the incident late meant the issue should not be investigated at all (wack)

3. Someone posted about the incident on reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/16i7l21/how_to_handle_misconduct_cases_in_school/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=3&utm_content=2), talking about how the SU president candidate is currently running uncontested despite all that he did.

4. After the post gained traction recently, NTUSU started deleting and hiding comments on their instagram page, obviously trying to wait it out and sweep it back under the rug. This went on for 2 days

5. 4 days after that, they then released a statement on Instagram which was 95% fluff, essentially admitted that the alcohol incident is true but he is still allowed to run for president uncontested.

 The outrageous thing isnt that the SU isnt doing anything--it's the management that sees this and decides to sit on their hands hoping it will blow over. 5 weeks of suspension yet he can run again uncontested reeks of poor management. Is NTU student body now so degraded that no one else but a man with an almost-criminal history is the sole person that is available to run for an organisation claims to be the ""voice of students""?

Getting a girl drunk doesn't mean you have malicious intent behind it. What happened to the shit and giggles of seeing someone drunk? Wonder if opinions will change if the gender changes to a guy instead. 

It's funny how when someone want to get a girl drunk, we all assume ""malicious intent"" I do agree in most cases, SA do happen when the girl is drunk but should we really assume this in every case?",1,0,,2023,9

706,Comment,16q2ga6,Soapbox interviewed the NTUSU victim and name dropped,europium19,2023-09-23 12:23:05+00:00,"**TLDR:**

1. Feeling lightheaded after a few drinks, Xinruo (victim) asked Ethan Ong for water, but he repeatedly gave her clear alcohol instead. Xinruo became so intoxicated that she vomited and fell unconscious.  

2.. Ethan Ong only cut it out when Dhanraj (outgoing NTUSU president) saw her reaction to what she was drinking and demanded he stop.  

3. Even so, Dhanraj told 2 eye-witnesses not to tell Xinruo about the incident, saying it could ruin the mood for her at a committee gathering the next day. They told her about it anyways.

4. Three days later, the incident was brought to the NTUSU disciplinary board, an internal panel of students that investigates and issues punishments for misconduct among union members.  

5. This board consisted of 3 members, including Dhanraj. They decided to suspend Ethan Ong for 5 weeks from NTUSU duties. Although he said Ethan had ""gone overboard in his actions"", Dhanraj directed everyone involved to ""keep the information of the suspension within the student union"".  

6. However, screenshots of Telegram chats seen by Soapbox reveal that Ethan continued holding discussions on union matters¬†in his capacity as an Exco member during his suspension. The suspension effectively did not exist.  

7. Ethan attended a dry run on Thursday for Sunday‚Äôs council rally, according to Exco messages seen by Karl. A transcript of a Friday meeting between top union officers, seen by Soapbox, also showed them referring to the presidential rally as ‚ÄúEthan‚Äôs rally.‚Äù

Personally I think it's not right for a girl to do this to a guy either. But he did this in secret, and lied to the president and to the girl that it was water. If it was ragging, hazing or ""toxic culture"" he would not try to hide it at all. The attempted secrecy definitely makes him infinitely more suspicious. What are the chances?

Please link a past case to prove your point. Otherwise it's a groundless ""what if"" scenario of no value. Please don't use personal anecdotes either, nobody can verify.

I know that I will definitely burn many bridges by writing this, but I feel the need to take full accountability, as opposed to the way the current EXCO are conducting themselves.

I am extremely disappointed in and appalled at the way NTUSU is handling the [allegations](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/16i7l21/how_to_handle_misconduct_cases_in_school/) against a student (""E"") elected to the 33rd EXCO during the recent Union Elections. I have made it clear since my first interview and my first day as a Ussociate that my goal was always this: to use NTUSU's platform create a safe space for SA victims and vulnerable students to approach and seek solace in. The individuals responsible for the untransparent and undemocratic elections process have crushed and wasted all my intentions and efforts, and tarnished the good names and work of those who share those intentions. Not a single student is willing to approach NTUSU regarding SA now. More importantly, they have blatantly shown that they simply do not care about representing the student body.

I hope that the student body (*not* the Union leadership) can step forward, **hold a vote of no confidence**, and reform the elections process and constitutional bylaws that led to this grievous lapse in accountability.

As much as how much memes I‚Äôve stirred with the EATEN post. I want to share a bit about how incompetent the whole Student Union is.

Nepotism, this one is quite obvious, if you are popular with the EXCO, especially the current president (R*j), you are pretty much given a position in the senior EXCO (VPs, treasurer, secretary and chief of staff) 

Of course the president will proceed to troubleshoot the committee, telling people not to run for the same role and make sure only 1 person is running for each important role, and of course that person is someone that wholly supports the president like a yes man

‚ÄúBorrowing of ideas‚Äù, SU members are generally people who lack any proper experience and ideas in domain outside of giving free stuff and organising camps and carnivals. So if they ever collaborate with other clubs, chances are they will attend a meeting with them, learn their ideas and do it on their own. Minus the need for co-branding, and also purposely overstepping the boundaries of other clubs.

I won‚Äôt speak much about the competencies of individual junior excos, some of them are good, some of them are bad, some of them literally joined NTU the month before as freshmen without any prior experience in NTU and somehow they got propelled to be an exco.

So far none of the times I‚Äôve worked with / for the SU have there been anything that is substantial or truly beneficial for students. It‚Äôs pretty much an exclusive club on who can meet more ministers, who have more pages on their resume.

PS I‚Äôve once heard a certain guy who haven‚Äôt EATEN saying ‚ÄúI want to go take photo with the minister‚Äù (or somewhere along that line) at a pretty big NTU private event (hosted by NTU management) last year where a minister was present",45,0,,2023,9

We still have 2 goals:

1. Getting justice for the victim, by getting the appropriate punishment for EATEN, the 5 weeks joke of a punishment isn‚Äôt going to cut it. Let‚Äôs make sure justice is served and he gets what he deserves for being a predator.

2. Pushing for actual change in NTUSU, 32 years of history, some years were good, most were bad, at least for the past few years. It is obvious that there‚Äôs a need to change the system, and elect real, actual leaders with a high level of responsibility and respect for their team and the NTU community. Instead of sucking each other off and inviting ministers for photo taking 

We don‚Äôt need another Dhanr*j to cover up mess ups for his favourite candidates, and parachuting his own friends and supporters into the key positions in SU, and giving biased decisions to protect and encourage people with absolutely no ethics to run for president. We need an actual SU that can represent our voices, and provide full transparency in their work.",130,0,,2023,9

Most of the post are actual filler garbage.

The alcohol thing is already the worst offence, and they said the ""more severe assertions about misconduct of a different nature are unsubstantiated""? What are the more severe ones, pray tell? In what world is being a bad council member, blaming your teammates etc. LESS SEVERE than the alcohol thing? At most the other allegations are petty nuisances, but the alcohol thing is literal sexual assault!

Also, no one has said the member has already attained the role of president. OP said he is running for president uncontested, which is true. This has not been addressed in the statement at all, and SU chose to write some fluff about how he is technically not the president yet and so on. 

They went on to say the person's details were kept quiet and they treated her with ""utmost sensitivity"", which contradicts OP who mentioned they gaslit and downplayed the event, and victim blamed, acting as if reporting the incident late means the perpetrator's crimes can be forgiven? OP also mentioned in a comment that the union has been pressuring the victim to reveal OP's name. That is absolutely disgusting. NTUSU did not provide any evidence against these and simply skirted over the issue. 

As for the reason they gave for hiding and deleting comments, they said it's because it was ""insensitive"" or ""disrespectful"". However, it seems that the comments were merely calling on NTUSU to address the issue, and they're trying not to seem like they are trying to keep the issue under the rug.",116,0,,2023,9

I don‚Äôt understand how anything apart from his full resignation is a reasonable outcome. Regardless of the setting, be it social or not, he acted in a manner that is unbecoming of a student, let alone an elected leader.

His reinstatement if anything, says more about the union than the antagonist himself. Professional standards are clearly lacking if they think his behaviour warrants only a slap on the wrist. Really, what are the repercussions for him apart from inactivity? So he acted like a fool, and now he don‚Äôt get to do any work. Where do I sign up? 

But that is purely my personal opinion - I don‚Äôt even know what NTUSU does, and how their existence benefits the average NTU student. And if you aren‚Äôt aware already, we do pay a union subscription fee.

Someone posted about the incident on reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/16i7l21/how_to_handle_misconduct_cases_in_school/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=3&utm_content=2), talking about how the SU president candidate is currently running uncontested despite all that he did.


4. After the post gained traction recently, NTUSU started deleting and hiding comments on their instagram page, obviously trying to wait it out and sweep it back under the rug. This went on for 2 days


5. 4 days after that, they then released a statement on Instagram which was 95% fluff, essentially admitted that the alcohol incident is true but he is still allowed to run for president uncontested. I doubt any sort of investigation happened despite them claiming to be investigating for the past 4 days.",40,0,,2023,9

Not the gotcha moment you think it is, u/StarrySloth99 ...this actually makes it worse because it's more of a slap on the wrist than a 3 month suspension. And the statement only said he was suspended from *union duties*  for 5 weeks, not from school.

I disagree. An internal investigation proves nothing if you're just ""ownself checking ownself"". If we cannot prove means we don't allow people to try to prove meh?

My guess is the algorithm prioritise-> close and compatible matches over-> priority of gender ratio.
They prioritise quality relationships over quantity matches. So I guessing your questionnaire answers is too unique for the small sample set of people.
Also means a lot of girls choose 1 to 1 relationships over multi people. Maybe they prefer loyalty more.
It also means they people who have more unique questionnaire are even less likely to get a match.

Dude got girl blackout drunk, repeatedly asked her if she was romantically interested, offered more clear alcohol and told her it was water, spread rumors that she likes him after being suspended

2. NTU gave him the lightest punishment possible to man (oop mentioned 3 month suspension, but ntusu said it's a 5 week suspension from union activities? Dawg that's even worse), and gaslit and victim-blamed, acting as if reporting the incident late meant the issue should not be investigated at all (wack)

3. Someone posted about the incident on reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/16i7l21/how_to_handle_misconduct_cases_in_school/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=3&utm_content=2), talking about how the SU president candidate is currently running uncontested despite all that he did.

4. After the post gained traction recently, NTUSU started deleting and hiding comments on their instagram page, obviously trying to wait it out and sweep it back under the rug. This went on for 2 days

5. 4 days after that, they then released a statement on Instagram which was 95% fluff, essentially admitted that the alcohol incident is true but he is still allowed to run for president uncontested. I doubt any sort of investigation happened despite them claiming to be investigating for the past 4 days.

https://soapbox.sg/2023/09/23/sole-ntusu-presidential-candidate-accused-by-younger-union-officer-of-tricking-her-into-getting-blackout-drunk/

1. Feeling lightheaded after a few drinks, Xinruo (victim) asked Ethan Ong for water, but he repeatedly gave her clear alcohol instead. Xinruo became so intoxicated that she vomited and fell unconscious.  

2.. Ethan Ong only cut it out when Dhanraj (outgoing NTUSU president) saw her reaction to what she was drinking and demanded he stop.  

3. Even so, Dhanraj told 2 eye-witnesses not to tell Xinruo about the incident, saying it could ruin the mood for her at a committee gathering the next day. They told her about it anyways.

4. Three days later, the incident was brought to the NTUSU disciplinary board, an internal panel of students that investigates and issues punishments for misconduct among union members.  

5. This board consisted of 3 members, including Dhanraj. They decided to suspend Ethan Ong for 5 weeks from NTUSU duties. Although he said Ethan had ""gone overboard in his actions"", Dhanraj directed everyone involved to ""keep the information of the suspension within the student union"".  

6. However, screenshots of Telegram chats seen by Soapbox reveal that Ethan continued holding discussions on union matters¬†in his capacity as an Exco member during his suspension. The suspension effectively did not exist.  

7. Ethan attended a dry run on Thursday for Sunday‚Äôs council rally, according to Exco messages seen by Karl. A transcript of a Friday meeting between top union officers, seen by Soapbox, also showed them referring to the presidential rally as ‚ÄúEthan‚Äôs rally.‚Äù

8. The Investiture (where Ethan will officially be declared President) will be held on 27 September, 7pm, LT2A. Free dinner will be served along with an opportunity to protest.

Even if he didn't touch her, he did intoxicate her, possibly with malicious intent. The fact that he kept tricking her into drinking ""water"" when it in fact is alcohol may likewise serve as a warning as to what's to come if he were Student President.

Think I read a hypothesis from r/nus, about their student president hosting some festival with NFTs, and potentially scamming the student populous with it. Though that case isn't proven, I would still very much NOT like that to happen here in NTU.

>Ppl can wear what they want and flaunt what they want its their choice, they just put themselves at risk if being robbed etc but the one in the wrong is not them but the one who robs. And the robber giving the excuse of the victim flaunting gold is not going to help him lighten his sentence of justify his wrongdoing :)


Yes, but if you actually get robbed you have to recognise that you are dumb for not protecting yourself in any way. Wanting the ability to do whatever you want is stupid, why do we even sell locks for? Why bother with accounts and passwords?

In this case, the girl did not get robbed at all despite flaunting her wealth, so I have no idea what punishment you want.",1,0,,2023,9

1210,Post,16wboda,Pineapple drama reminder:,ntuthroaway,2023-09-30 16:48:53+00:00,"It is not just a pineapple who should be the subject of controversy but rather the entire leadership of the 32nd exco team. Why did leadership deem it fit to cover up the incident and only mete out a mere 5 weeks suspension from the union as ""punishment""? Furthermore, why didn't any of the other members who were present at the incident raise the issue up to NTU itself, but rather chose to cover it up and follow along with the decisions of the then president? 

We all had to take a primer on acceptable conduct as students when we matriculated,  o it begs the question: did the SU team conveniently forget these principles?  Furthermore, if the exco team saw it acceptable to cover up this incident, how can we be sure that there haven't been more serious incidents that were covered up? I hope that everyone keeps these points in mind, and that we will bring them up when SU finally stops cowering and actually hosts the AGM.  
To add on, I find it kind of suspicious that we are now getting posts calling out the veracity and motives of the original poster who broke the story. Does anyone else remember the Uwave drama [https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/lfxw2x/opinion\_ntusu\_attempted\_to\_slander\_uwave\_as\_a/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/lfxw2x/opinion_ntusu_attempted_to_slander_uwave_as_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) ,  with SU manufacturing outrage in order to get out of a partnership deal that subjected the union to transparency and scrutiny which they quickly collapsed under? This smells exactly like the same tactics previously employed in order to quell the flames of this particular fire. 

And let's not forget the efforts of CDG Booboos, who is currently working closely together with CDG to address bus bunching issues, a job that should have been done by NTU SU in the first place. The Union should have offered the resources to them and collaborated with them on the campus purple idea, but what did we get instead? The union allegedly asking them to stop providing feedback, because it would give the school a bad name. NUS SU didn't go down this path. Instead, they now have that bus enthusiast guy who keeps their shuttle bus service in check. 

Plus, what about the failed movement to get NTU to change their bursary funding process? It had substantial momentum and the school was forced to meet with them. If they had the backing of the union, we might have gotten a better bursary support system. But instead, the school now refuses to engage with them and tells them to submit their petition to the union before they'll consider anything. Looking at what the Union has done in the past few years, I now understand why. Once anything gets to the student union, if it can't give them quick gains, they just let it starve off and die.

Just look at their track record: the is the same union that shamelessly ripped off CDG Booboos' idea for campus purple, passed it off as their own and then subsequently, crickets. 

The same union that also tried to ""lobby"" for a better hall housing solution, provided ""helpful feedback"", only to give us a band-aid solution in the form of the hall boarding scheme. 

I urge everyone to not forget the core issue at heart, which is greater accountability and transparency from NTU SU. Please don't let the issue die off because ""we can't do anything"", because as of right now, we still have the momentum to force them to change their ways. I'm suspecting that the Union is trying to take advantage of recess week to starve off the momentum that we currently have until the AGM, where they'll only have to deal with a few naysayers.

Had the AGM gone as planned, we would have had the best turnout in NTU history and the manpower to demand some change. If we let the SU off easy, we'd be sending a message to future exco members that if they have drama that is too hot, all they need to do is to lay low until the issue burns out. I hope someone seriously considers forcing the SU to hold an Extraordinary General Meeting if the AGM gets postponed for too long, because we cannot let this issue become buried. 

We as students need to demand that our Union actually starts representing us, instead of taking 9 hall points every year and only feeding us some bubble tea and facial products every year or so.

Dude got a girl blackout drunk, repeatedly asked her if she was romantically interested, offered more clear alcohol and told her it was water, spread rumors that she likes him after being suspended

2. NTU gave him the lightest punishment possible to man (oop mentioned 3 month suspension, but ntusu said it's a 5 week suspension from union activities? Dawg that's even worse), and gaslit and victim-blamed, acting as if reporting the incident late meant the issue should not be investigated at all (wack)

3. Someone posted about the incident on reddit [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/16i7l21/how_to_handle_misconduct_cases_in_school/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=3&utm_content=2), talking about how the SU president candidate is currently running uncontested despite all that he did.

4. After the post gained traction recently, NTUSU started deleting and hiding comments on their instagram page, obviously trying to wait it out and sweep it back under the rug. This went on for 2 days

5. 4 days after that, they then released a statement on Instagram which was 95% fluff, essentially admitted that the alcohol incident is true but he is still allowed to run for president uncontested. I doubt any sort of investigation happened despite them claiming to be investigating for the past 4 days.",8,0,,2023,9
1278,Post,16newn4,[Serious] Petition to Implement a Student/Staff Price and Public Price for all Food Courts,GabenIsCrazy3nity,2023-09-20 07:24:24+00:00,"NTU's pretty well-known for its food, and for good reason. Most things are affordable and food quality is honestly quite good, not much complaints there.

But as people returned to their offices over the past year or so, the crowd situation across all the food courts have been getting ridiculous. On top of the students, staff and faculty (which already makes up quite a considerable portion of the crowd) we often also see a considerable number of employees from CleanTech and surrounding offices take up tables around the school and start having their lunchtime meetings and discussions in NTU, all when students and staff are scrambling around hunting for seats when their next class is 30 mins away.

This isn't normal. NUS has student and staff prices precisely due to their close proximity to the Science Park and one-north office clusters around. Pricing measures are not to completely deter these office workers from coming, but to take advantage of their large numbers **and** to control crowd levels to a certain extent, such that food courts ever so *slightly* favour the students and staff instead of the public.

Considering NTU's locked in some pretty heavy construction projects right now, we should also apply that same lower pricing for the workers involved. But the public should be priced out considerably.

Koufu is overpriced as hell for the quality of food it has

South spine food is slightly cheaper but its not accessible for those who have classes around the north side

Some of the hall canteen food is expensive as well (crespion hot teh is 1.20 compared to south spine's 80/90cents) (a plate of sweet n sour pork rice at hall 2 is almost $6)

Now food in NTU seems even more expensive than outside. $5 for crappy noodles soup when it's $4.50 at pioneer area? 

But I don't agree with separate pricing for students. This works for a short period before the hassle and daily friction wears stall owners down. There are examples of places that have two tier pricing but stall owners just simply give everyone the student price.

So today I was caught smoking near my hall on campus, and a staff member approached me to ask for my matric card. I replied that I had lost it, but he kept demanding me to produce a form of identification. In the spur of the moment I rly wanted to get away from him ASAP so I made up an excuse that I had sth on and just walked away with him shouting at me to come back.  What can I expect to happen next? Will I get fined?

As a victim of sexual assault (even though THIS is not a sexual assault case), i can empathise with the victim as being tricked into intoxication, and having narratives controlled by a group of ENABLERS, and fear of retaliation & being disbelieved is scary and traumatising. No one likes being publicly visible and disclose a traumatic incident and being discredited as a pathological liar. 

It is not a sexual assault case and it can be a stretch to call him a predator, but you cannot discount how concerning it is to have such person in powerful positions who are unapologetic and normalise harming their subordinates. How can we expect the student uniok to represent us when it only benefit a small selected minority? How can the school insist on only having student union as the communication channel for any issues while shutting off other student groundup movements and expect them to be confident that their concerns are met? 

Lets not minimise this incident anymore as it is a sign of a larger problems.",4,0,,2023,10

Disclaimer: this is a rage post, don't read if you don't like rage post",Unknown,2023-09-12 14:47:01+00:00,"Normally, I am very easy going, but today I cannot bear it anymore. I have a headache and after seeing this doctor, I have an additional mental headache.

Terrible experience with Dr. MBST at Fullerton today (let me know in the comment if you want the name, else I'll leave her anonymous). How can this person even be a doctor?? Totally unprofessional and rude with a neglected attitude. I feel that my health concerns are neglected and my symptoms are ignored.

At first, she keeps asking me unrelated questions like which year I am in or am I doing internship. How does it help with diagnosing my illness?

Then she asks for symptoms. I was extremely tired and fatigued for 2 days. I had a terrible headache and body aches. I was so tired to the point that I slept all day and only woke up to eat. I didn‚Äôt take my temperature until last night, I had 37.8C fever at 4am with headache. Basically, same symptoms as covid except running nose. 

She takes my temperature and I‚Äôm not having fever at the time. She shows me and says ‚Äúno fever‚Äù. I say that last night at 4am I had fever and I took fever pill to ease the fever. She insists that that‚Äôs last night, right now I don‚Äôt have a fever and she doesn‚Äôt believe me. She insists that I was tired because I just finished my period (I‚Äôm sure it not the reason, my period finished like 5, 6 days ago) and I have low iron in blood. Does low iron cause fever?? NO. Can I have fever caused by period after my period was clean for a week?? IS THIS EVEN A QUESTION?? She totally ignores my fever!

She says that I come again when I have fever. Like, what? She cannot believe her patient? After all the fever pills and the photo of my 37.8C temperature I show her but she ignores? The clinic is not that accessible. Plus, I took the fever pill, which helps me less tired so that I can reach the clinic. I wouldn‚Äôt be able to even leave my hall when I had fever. I feel like I‚Äôm gonna pass out midway!

She asks if I have a sore throat. I say that sometimes I have and right now I don‚Äôt have. She uses the light to see my throat and concludes that I don‚Äôt have a sore throat! AGAIN! She ignores my symptoms! My friend who was diagnosed with common flu had the same symptoms as me, and I just met him recently so possibly I also have flu. He also had on and off sore throat. But with this doctor, ‚Äúsometimes‚Äù means never have sore throat.

She gives me 1 day MC. I need more. I have been sick for 3 days and the symptoms are still. She just doesn‚Äôt care and only gives me 1. I repeat again that I had fever last night and she can‚Äôt see it now because I took fever pill. I even bring that fever pill with me and show her. She doesn‚Äôt bother. I took picture of my thermometer last night and sent it to my friend. I want to show her that. She doesn‚Äôt bother. She insists that the number she is reading RIGHT NOW says that I don‚Äôt have fever. What does she expect?? I had a fever and terrible headache at 4am! I had fever pills with me from the last covid. What was I supposed to do? Of course, I would take the pill and wait until the clinic is open the next morning. What does she expect me to do? Suffering from my fever and headache for 5 hours just to prove to her that I have real fever???

She even says that 37.8C is not high with a totally neglected attitude. What is considered to be high enough so that she will care? 40 degrees C? Oh wow when I saw doctor outsides ntu, they already considered I have light fever at 37.5 and 37.8 is definitely a fever.

Then she concludes that I don‚Äôt have a running nose, sore throat (which I actually have but she ignores it), not covid. I say that last night I tested covid and it‚Äôs not. She says if it‚Äôs not then not serious and I‚Äôm good. HELLO??? What is considered serious to her? Is common flu serious enough? Sounds like covid is the only reasonable illness to her.

Her attitude gives me an obvious feeling that she thinks that I‚Äôm faking my illness. I‚Äôm so frustrated that she insists that I only need 1 day MC even though I have been unable to do anything for 3 days. People say that you need to be honest and do not hide anything from your doctor. Seems like with this doctor, even when you are the most honest person, she will not believe unless she sees you dying in front of her eye. Else, even if you say that you are dying, she will still ignore your symptoms. Omg how can this person even become a doctor?

1540,Post,16r35ux,Proposed actions for AGM: [Repost cuz me bobo and forgot that chat links get posts auto deleted :c],ntuthroaway,2023-09-24 17:17:23+00:00,"old post with comments here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/16qw430/proposed\_actions\_for\_agm/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/16qw430/proposed_actions_for_agm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Given the outcome of the (s)election, I have no confidence in the 33rd NTU SU exco in their ability to adequately address our concerns and represent us should they be allowed to continue on as if nothing happened.

Thus, I propose that we, the student body:

1. Press them for an answer during the AGM as to what is actually going on behind the scenes. ""Alcohol incidents"" are not just an incident, but an extremely serious breach of trust and a reflection of extremely poor character. If the grilled pineapple was willing to take advantage of his team members before he became president, just what kind of abuse would have happened if he became the most powerful person of NTU and granted with the abilities to cover up anything that he wished?
2. Demand an explanation as to why the SU President saw it fit to bury the incident and not inform the victim of what happened. 32nd Exco is equally culpable of wrongdoing here, and as the president, the buck should have stopped with him. It is appalling that he thought to resolve the issue through at first, not informing the victim and then inserting himself into the disciplinary ""hearing"". It is even more appalling that there seems to be no checks and balances present within the exco body, as this issue has only surfaced because someone had the guts to whistleblow.

2a. What exactly has SU done to benefit us? We now know that they sidelined the guy running CDG boo-boos in an attempt to ""improve the university's image"". Once again, why was this allowed, instead of bringing them on board to address the issue of poor bus service? Furthermore, why are they now monitoring CDG by themselves instead of having union support?

2b. Hall overcrowding problem. Has the SU actually taken any measures with the school on this issue? Seems that they are only interested in continuing the trend of inviting juniors to drink water in their rooms, instead of policies such as nudging the school to impose harsher penalties on the students who sublet. Hall boarding scheme is a joke, and a band aid on a deeper problem.

3. If point 2 is not realized during the AGM, I propose that we as students walk out during the convocation as a sign of protest, after which we submit a request for an Extraordinary General Meeting with the 33rd Exco to get to the bottom of this, along with a roadmap of what they plan to do to rectify their problems.

4. Finally, if no resolution can be attained, we conduct a vote of no confidence for the 33rd Exco. It is time that we as students show that merely feeding us bbt is not enough, we require a union that is actually run by the students, for the students.

These are just my thoughts, so for brevity, here are other suggestions that we can include into the agenda from nanthascrubber:[https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/16qw430/comment/k1ztot1/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/16qw430/comment/k1ztot1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

EDIT: special mention to this comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/16qw430/comment/k1zenar/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/16qw430/comment/k1zenar/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) I guess this would be point 5 on the agenda to bring up to SU, since if true, it would at best, be grounds for some concern, and at worst, a major conflict of interest.

Edit 2:New soapbox article just dropped, it seems that the new president was voted in BEFORE the other candidate had a chance to host his rally?!*""Annabel was voted in before Likhith held his rally, according to a senior union member, who spoke to Soapbox.sg on condition of anonymity. She was elected as the 33rd NTUSU president, with 12 votes for, eight against and 11 abstaining.""* \[Lok, 2023\]

\[\[Edit 3: New info from \[Wakeupsg,2023\] States that the other candidate could only have run if the first person's bid failed, due to him not putting his name forward at the same time as them. Wow, color me surprised that I, as a NTU SU member, don't even know how the heck our elections are carried out! Truly a job well done, NTUSU. In any case, it doesn't change my sentiments below\]\]

If this is true, then why are even bother hosting another election in the first place? Shouldn't both candidates be allowed to have the chance to make their speech before voting commences? I'm spitballing here, but I suspect that this might be why the alleged results had so many abstaining votes.

Ntu staff say they want to communicate only with ntusu members as they are the ""democratically elected"" representatives of the student body, when, well.. üôÑ

Has the SU actually taken any measures with the school on this issue? Seems that they are only interested in continuing the trend of inviting juniors to drink water in their rooms, instead of policies such as nudging the school to impose harsher penalties on the students who sublet. Hall boarding scheme is a joke, and a band aid on a deeper problem.

I second this, given that this is a real problem for many people in NTU, given the time required to take public transport to NTU is significant, even for people who stay in the west.

Per google maps, to reach boon lay itself, it requires around 15-30 minutes depending on where you start from and time of day, and this doesn't include the possibility that the bus would be full and you would be unable to board. Most places have a minimum of 1hour travel time, with some places reaching 1.5 or nearly 2 hours.

This kind of travel time would mean that you spend 10-20% of the waking day on travel, which is a bit ridiculous. Even the NTU shuttle buses to the heartland areas don't significantly cut down on this timing, at most shaving off 1 hour daily, depending on proximity to the pickup and dropoff points, and only departs at specific times.

&#x200B;

Back to the actual interesting calculations, per NTU brochures, they are capable of ""housing more than 13,000 undergraduates"". Being generous, we shall take this to mean that they can house 14000 undergraduates.

&#x200B;

We now note that the 2022 undergrad population is 23876 full time students, and assuming that all take a 4 year course, and 1st and 2nd years take the offer for the 2 years of guaranteed hall stay, we have 11938 undergrads in halls

Now assuming this would compromise all of the category A admissions, we look at category B admissions. To spare some of the math, category B admissions to hall (by SFIR reccomendation, hall council, SU/Constituent Club, and Uni Sports Scheme, and assuming all slots are fully utilized) is around 139 per hall \* 23 under grad halls, for a total of 3197 undergraduates

Now we see that...oh dear, 11938 + 3197 = 15135 > 14000.

Oh dear. What would the category C people (which are those who do it on pure CCA points alone) do?  


Let's also not forget that the old hall 7 is no longer housing students which means they basically have closed 1 hall without any increase in capacity elsewhere",7,0,,2023,9

Seems like I've been summoned thank you for the mention really! 

As of now the loading capacities of the buses are still not right (they display inaccurate loading especially coach buses)

So far right now the AI are still making mistakes especially on red loop (e.g. injecting a 3rd bus into 2 already bunching buses that are non terminating at LWN) due to a lack of distinguishing parameters between coach and low-floor bus.

Hence manual rostering is still required which defeats the purpose. 

Gonna insert a ""told you so"" moment here when I kept preaching that we won't be able to easily solve the bunching on red bus without new measures, and it's still the same after a year with bunching (and I have evidence for that)

And at night now after 8pm the buses are actually 30 mins interval (but I cut them some slack for them to save cost on operating, the buses capacity are okay except for rainy days)

Hearsay from ISBMan that NUS situation has stabilized as all their buses are low-floor, and the algorithm is able to run smoothly.",9,0,,2023,9

1610,Post,16sbx8z,AGM postponement and momentum,nantahscrubber,2023-09-26 02:47:23+00:00,"A lot has come to pass since [the initial post](https://reddit.com/r/SGExams/s/7QhM4TJkpK) made on r/SGExams went online on 15 Sep. Many students were interested in attending the AGM to make their concerns heard.

Besides calling on the EXCO of NTU Accountancy and Business Club to hold a vote of no confidence, this chapter has come to a close. Instead of wasting our breath on a witch hunt or memeing this guy (as fun as it has been), we should engage in a constructive discourse about the future of NTUSU. There are two immediate questions facing us:

1. **Who should NTUSU represent?** Do we want a secretive and undemocratically chosen few to represent us, being a union only in name? Or should we stand for [reforming NTUSU](https://reddit.com/r/NTU/s/qX28IxBDAl) as a transparent and independent student union from the ground up? And how should we involve all students in the laying the foundations for a new student union as equals?

2. The postponement of the AGM, whether intentionally or not, will most likely hamper the momentum built over the last few days. How should we put it out there that an indepdent student union doesn't just concern a ""vocal minority"", but the lives of all students? From funding and supporting our beloved CCAs, to fairer academic policies; from taking student initiatives seriously, to more equitable financial aid? In other words, **how should we keep the momentum going until the next AGM**, when we can seek resolution to questions unanswered and come together to rebuild NTUSU?

If we focus on these two matters, a better student union lies within reach.",78,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/16sbx8z/agm_postponement_and_momentum/,2023,9

(In fact, I initiated the call for meetings with my committee and the policy team.) I've gone through SU's elections regulations and constitution.

It is an open secret that candidates for key roles in the NTUSU EXCO are hand-picked by past EXCO members; at the very least, it cannot be denied that having only one representative contest each key office precludes a diversity of voices and perspectives on policy positions, especially re: SU's relationship to NTU management.

Democracy is not a set of formal rules and procedures to follow. It is a living, breathing complex of attitudes and activities and social formations. For unions, its lifeblood is independence.

Like for MAE ik even if you dabao a prerequisite mod, you would still have been considered as having cleared the prerequisite mod, and can take the more advanced mod.

You say you are overwhelmed with workload? Do your batch-mates also feel the same way?
- If not, the problem is on YOU, perhaps you're not setting aside as much time, effort or mental preparation to complete the courses you applied for the semester. Unfortunately, your GPA will inevitably be bad.
- If yes (ie. Majority of your batch-mates feel overwhelmed too), then everyone feels the same, it's level playing field. You just have to persist on and study harder than them to get 'better' GPA.

As someone who has been working for 10+ years, I'd say GPA does not really matter once you get your first job and/or be in the industry for 3+ years.

BUT, I do believe that GPA is a good reflection of how you will also perform in the workplace in the medium-longer term, especially in non-natural-science field of study such as NBS. Someone who graduates first class usually will also have the mentality and capability to climb higher in faster manner.

So I suggest to focus on your study, don't surrender too fast, rethink how you can optimize your time and mental space better to support course workload. Having classmates that are in the right academic mindset is also crucial to help you persevere.",26,0,,2023,9
1708,Comment,16hrh1i,nbs gpa importance,prioriority,2023-09-13 23:45:44+00:00,"I think good GPA is like spending 4 years and tens of thousands of dollars creating an effective thumbnail on a YouTube video: If done right, it will catch a lot of eyeballs, increase the number of people interested enough to check you out (give an interview) and is definitely important... if the metric you are measuring is how many people give you and opportunity to interview with them.

And just like my YouTube analogy, some thumbnails are far better than the actual video (your interview is bad, or when hired your performance is terrible, or you are just an unbearable person altogether), some thumbnails are pure clickbait, no substance.

The proven method to get a good job (I'm assuming you want a good GPA for this reason) is to have people make word of mouth recommendations for you. I don't mean testimonials. I mean LITERALLY people who are important and powerful talking to their friends about how good you are, and then these friends then come hire you.

To that end, GPA is almost meaningless. People who matter will only recommend you based on your ability. These abilities are almost never content-related, but instead almost always skills-related. These skills come from (ironically) the activities you do that will jeopardize your GPA. Things like CCA exco that put you in a position to talk with important people, your part-time job as a bartender, your part time tuition work, etc. Something that allows you to demonstrate the sort of reliable person that you are and that people can trust you with responsibility.

Long story short, spend less time studying. Spend more time working and demonstrating ability and character.

EDIT: To complete my YouTube analogy, a relatively poorer GPA is like the viral video that doesn't have a nice thumbnail. It's still going viral because people are recommending it to others.",25,0,,2023,9

There was even an article recently saying GPA and CCA is no longer enough, and the rat race has moved into competing for internships as well. 

If you do well in internships, companies (other than the ultra competitive) will be willing to wait for you. I converted from my internship to a full-time position and literally no one cares that I graduated with FCH. The only difference is HR bumped up my pay by a really huge amount of $100.

IMO if you can go from poly or JC to uni and your grades were well within the cut-off, you don't have to worry about your GPA. For most people who are not monster scholars, the attitude and tenacity is what will get you ahead of others in the bell curve, not book smarts.

IMHO, to get 3.5 and below, you'd need to:

* not do your preparatory work before and after seminars

* know that you don't know a bunch of things AND are very okay with leaving that be, so you don't bother to find out

* rely on putting more effort into other people at the lower percentiles of the bell curve who put in even lesser effort (i.e hope that there are people who bochup more than you) 

Basically, you need to not know stuff, not put in the effort, and be very okay with going into exams ready to leave guess the answers to more than half the questions. 

Most other times if you put in consistent and disciplined effort, I think 4 and above is very possible. It's not easy by any means, because nothing about uni is easy, but generally if you are smart/strategic about your studying, efforts will translate to results.",3,0,,2023,9

In any case, NBS is very easy to get FCH. They literally let anyone in these days - used to be 75-80 RP floor, now dropped to 60+ RP. Quality of people and culture is dissapointing.

Just take a grip of your time. Study efficiently, not hard. Spend more time networking and preparing for internships. Those should be your real focus. GPA is just a means to an end, not an end in itself.

Investment banking at BB needs at least 4.5+ to break into their SA programs, likewise 4.7+ for management consulting . Once you're offered the FT job, the GPA doesn't matter at all. Not everyone is cut for the brutal hours and cutthroat environment but kind you these jobs pay frash grad 10-15k BASE a month fresh out of school. Bonus 50-150% for IB.

The professor started the midterm at about 3:28 and cut the paper at 4:20, even though it was supposed to be a 60 minute paper.

Furthermore he only gave notice that he was ending the paper at 4:20 at 4:15, giving people only 5 minutes to rush the remaining part of the paper. 10 minutes isn't an insignificant amount of time it is 1/6 of the time we should have had.

Fortunately for my batch, there wasn‚Äôt any lecture following his, so we were given the full hour to complete it.

If the prof is still the same prof (SHS), the midterm would have been an open book test where he reuses at least 80% of the questions and answers from previous midterms so that answers could basically be copied as long as you had the resources to get them. Were the questions this time completely new? Because if so, then I would definitely understand your frustration and would probably bring this up to the school, but if they weren‚Äôt then I don‚Äôt think there is much to do since he did allow students to bring anything into the test as reference, and he already did pre-warn that the paper could be ended early. 

Regardless, back then, the duration was surprisingly long enough (we already all knew that we had to rush to complete the paper within an hour) considering that he had quite a number of questions since they were reused, and I noticed back then that majority of the students were able to finish the midterm paper within 50 minutes as well.",-6,0,,2023,9

My issue with what he said was that, he's basically admitting that this is a persisting issue whereby students aren't given the full 60min for the test for the past few **years**?Then why not try to **RESOLVE** the issue? Rather then just saying ""Oh well, it's been like this"", I'm sure there is a way to solve it right? Possibly:

1. Book another empty LT, that way you can ensure that nobody is using the location after
2. Liase with the next class's prof. I mean, we're having a **MID-TERMS** afterall...it's 20%. If it's just like a 5% or maybe 10% quiz, I guess *maybe* we can close one eye?But **just** for that day, *surely*, the other class can afford to wait awhile, if they're just having their usual lecture?
3. Use today's (Tuesday) 2hours slot instead. This is the one I'm most confused on, because I recall some other profs doing the same for their mod. 1 hour test, the other hour resume lesson. Plus, it's literally just a difference of **ONE DAY**?

At the end of the day, maybe all the above solutions won't work, for some reasons. I have no idea.I just feel that, like come on, dude's a **PROFESSOR**. He's definitely smart & capable. He knows this is an issue. But yet, he doesn't want to find ways to circumvent?

My study tips from poly were used in uni as they are very similar. I did study hard for my poly and used the same technique. Some poly -> uni students found it difficult because they did relatively well in poly without much studying, thats why in uni, will be harder for them to find a technique that fits the uni content.

To put it simply, u should:

1) Attend all your lectures (if recorded, never go above 1.25 speed).

2) Take notes of ur lectures on ur slides or pdf.

3) Do your tutorials. (this should be done within 2 to 3 days after the lecturer)

4) Make notes based on the lecture notes and tutorials (prefer type written)

5) After tutorial classes, clarify doubt with ur prof by emailing / stay back after class

6) Point 1 to 4 should be done in speed. By week 4, you should have completed week 5 tutorials. This will give u ample time to focus on mid term tests / projects.

7) For exams, u should start doing past year paper 4 weeks before ur exam. That should be week 11 (skip those qns that are to be taught in week 12 or 13). Come back to those qns after week 12 and 13. Past yr paper should be done at least 5 to 6 papers. 

8) Repeat tutorials 2 times. Repeat your past yr paper.

9) by week 13 lecture, ur notes should be completed and printed out for exams (and it helps u to do ur pyp and highlight important points along the way of doing pyp)

Ive done it. It is difficult. But with discipline it should be ok.

I feel like I‚Äôm no longer getting away with the strats I used in poly, studying till late and chiong-ing everything, but you‚Äôll slip and fall behind VERY fast, so try and use some way to organise your studies if you aren‚Äôt already.

also remember that if you‚Äôre having a hard time, you‚Äôre not alone for sure, and try your best to get back up whenever you don‚Äôt do well. don‚Äôt mug to the point that you burn out, but don‚Äôt take it too lightly too. try to find a good balance! all the best :)",2,0,,2023,9

No, the transition was tough. Things were much faster, much tougher, and much more competitive. I ended up graduating with borderline FCH but I did everything I could for it. Took modules during special semesters so I had more time during teaching weeks, studied entire days in my final semester with 2 module (one of which felt like at least 8 or 10 AUs...), etc.

You need a proper and smart study strategy. Mine was focused around reinforcing my learning as the weeks went by to never fall behind, and to create my own notes so I had everything I needed in a single place. This manifested into spending hours after lessons or on weekends to go through that week's materials and manually putting them together into word documents and flow charts.

Granted, I‚Äôm not in a particularly hard course like CS where the academic rigour is more intense, but I‚Äôm still falling behind in my readings and tutorials whereas it feels like everyone else who came from JC are transitioning more smoothly. 

What I felt comfortable in: 
- Groupwork. Poly really makes you toughen up and not expect anything from your peers haha. Delegation of work and experience from using other project management tools during internship also really helped with organising meetings and making sure presentations come together well

- Self studying. Poly lecturers were not very helpful depending on what kind you get and not sure about other courses but mine tend to be quite old‚Ä¶ I got used to doing things on my own and getting by but was pleasantly surprised by how different uni profs are. 

Still trying to get used to:
- Having so many things to read and absorbing large chunks of info from required texts. Of course, I expected that there would be a big change from poly but the first few weeks were a but rough. 

- Pace of uni life. Things go so fast in uni. I‚Äôd recommend going through tutorials/ lectures on the day that you have them to save time and retain the info. 

Overall, not bad ah. I would still choose poly over JC if I could go back in time. I just feel that u need to be very good at time management to keep up with the pace and content that uni expects for a good grade.",1,0,,2023,9

1813,Comment,16sjoii,Poly -> Uni,FireIceJohn20,2023-09-29 00:57:55+00:00,"Just gonna post my story of how I even got into Poly in the first place before my admission into NTU. I applied for Poly courses during my 2nd year of Army under the JPAE/DAE exercise (Can't really remember which one it was, since that was way back in 2015) after failing to get into one before Army, as I had missed the submission deadline. Anyway, the 5 choices that I have made are mainly Information Technology (IT) or Game Design related under TP/NP/NYP. The Game Design choices were mainly because of what I had studied as a Higher NITEC student in ITE (Game Design & Development), where my GPA was considered to be below average; hence failing the aforementioned JPAE/DAE exercise prior to enlisting.  
  
Nevertheless, I submitted the application and there is only one Poly that got back to me. And that Poly is none other than Republic Poly, offering me the course of EEE. At first, I was quite shocked that none of the choices that I have selected shortlisted me. Instead, it was the poly that I hadn't indicated an interest in that accepted me. At that point, I had made up my mind to try and do my best in doing well and making sure that I am able to clinch that diploma no matter what. Fast forward to 2017, the very first semester begins at RP and there will definitely be instances of 'brain rust' from being in the Army for 2 years. I was fortunate enough to be able to understand the concepts taught in the modules in a relatively short amount of time, thanks to the patience of the facilitators (lecturers); which also resulted in me helping out some of my peers who are struggling.  
  
Now comes the ugly part of being in a RP classroom environment, the students themselves. In contrast to NTU, the classrooms in RP constantly has a source of noise pollution; usually from the class jokers/clowns distracting the other students from learning by making small talk with them or disturbing the facilitators while they are teaching. It takes a great amount of discipline to be able to focus in class and understand the concepts, whilst being in an almost circus-like environment. I honestly despise the students who call RP 'ITE North', as if it were not the same students themselves proving it so.  
  
In regards to the project/group work assignments, I would like to share one unforgettable experience in a first year core module, Engineering Design. Before that, I would like to express a heartfelt appreciation to the only team member (Wei Si) that aided me in finishing the project together, as well as the lecturer for the class (Ms. Lindy). To give a quick summary, the module is about creating an ergonomic solution to improve everyday life for people from all walks of life. The class assigned into groups of 5 by the lecturer and we are to brainstorm on an idea to work on for the entirety of the mini-project. My team consisted of me, Wei Si, and 3 dumb\*\*\*es whose sole purposes of being in the project are to be the vile leeches that they are. One comes to class just to draw anime characters and live in his own world, and the other one doesn't even bother coming half the time. He was subsequently caught by our lecturer in the library slacking while during lesson hours.  
  
Already off to a great start at the start of the module, but it only gets worse. The 3rd was objectively worse than the other 2, as we had to clean up after his nonsense. He was tasked to do research on the topic that we are researching on, but he plainly just copied and pasted content directly without citing the websites as the sources. We ended up having to paraphrase for him and find out which exactly are the websites that he sourced from. Our lecturer knew about this issue, but could only help us on the side by advising on how to go about writing the report and the type of information to be included within it. It goes without saying that we marked the 3 of them down in the contribution and peer evaluation table, and they suffered the dire consequences during the final presentation of the project. The both of us presented our parts without any issues, but the 3 of them had to smoke through the presentation by making up bull\*\*\* on the spot. Karma is really hitting them hard when they couldn't answer any questions from the examiner during the Q&A session and just look at each other blankly. They ended up barely passing the module and we are fortunate enough to not encounter them again in the subsequent years.  
  
Anyway, upon reaching the end of my student life at RP, I was fortunate enough to apply successfully to Direct 2nd Year EEE at NTU. Life at NTU was indeed tough, as most of the students at EEE are known to be very stressed out at the amount of workload they have for each semester; especially for a Direct 2nd Year Student. The experience of group assignments is significantly improved over the one at RP, where every member are willing to step up and complete what they are assigned to do. But of course, there will be a handful that will just be nonchalant and throw everything over to their teammates to handle. The most important point to excel in Uni is to be consistent, especially in making notes, completing tutorials prior to the next lesson and handing up assignments on time. NTU definitely tests your mettle, but it does build up your resilience towards life in general and your future career in the long run.

To make things worse, I learn pretty slow and it's currently week 4 and I still haven't completed week 3(some week 2) yet. I haven't gotten used to uni life and have not made a friend. 

How do y'all actually cope with all these mods while having other commitments and managing your own mental health. 

These are the mods I'm taking this sem,
MH1810 Math 1
MH1812 Discrete math
SC1003 Intro to programming
SC1005 Digital Logic
SC1013 Physics for computing
CC0005 HL and WB
CC0003 Ethics

I should've dropped 1 or 2 mods during add drop but it's too late.

I've learnt some of the content in these mods in poly/sec but I have brain rot from NS and I still haven't gotten used to studying again + everything is digital(so not used to this). T_T

I have a bunch of questions and any advice will be greatly appreciated.

Any advice to cope with studies?

What mindsets do y'all have in uni? 

Any tips or resources that worked for you?

Are lectures/tutorials really necessary if everything is recorded(I've attended only 1 tutorial so far)?

Is it really harder to make friends in uni? 

Anything other random advice are also appreciated!

Thank you in advance for your time and effort to reply to this post.

Edit 1: 10 Sep 2023
I picked up the motivation to catch up on my studies and got PTSD from MH1810 again. 

I tried doing the online assignment after reading the notes and watching the recorded lectures. I was able to do the first few questions and after that I realised why I broke down last week in the first place. 

Having to spend more time on MH1810 but still unable to do the assignment really pushed back my study schedule by a lot. It's really depressing how even though I'd put in so much time and effort into the topic and I'm still unable to do the assignment.

However, this time, instead of breaking down and delaying my studies again, I'm gonna try some suggestions I found in this sub like Khan Academy and Organic Chem Teacher. And if it still doesn't work, I'll try focusing on my other mods first, I don't want this MH1810 mod to drag me down even further.

2. Set lower expectations. High expectations tend to lead to greater disappointment.

3. Form a study group with people in your course. Studying with friends tend to help you absorb content faster esp when you can discuss tutorial or assignment with them.

4. Making friends in uni isn‚Äôt so tough when there is hall / CCA / interest groups apart from course mate. 

5. Whenever in doubt, try to clarify with prof on the spot or friends that can absorb content faster by compiling weekly doubts with them. Arrange for weekly consults or checks in with peers. This may present yourself as alittle annoying or thick-skinned since you clarify every little things.

I was from a related field in poly, have been interested in IT all these while. But coming here, I feel like I got crushed by concepts like recursion which was already taught in Week 2 in the basic Programming Methodology, and will be used over and over again in future topics. Still, until now in Week 4, I don't fully understand it and there's an assessment (a written test) coming up this Friday. Not even sure how I'll fare, but I told myself, I'll just put in my best and see how it goes from there.

Definitely, I might not do well for this course because I'm slow too. Maybe my CAP will be crappy for this sem. But, after all, we have barely treaded into this uni journey and still don't know what lies ahead. Who knows, maybe there'll be future courses that may be our time to shine?

5,Comment,17ap7t1,Ethan Ong pursues lawsuit against student for $100k,SteelSW,2023-10-18 14:33:32+00:00,"What's happening to Nadine is really sad but my main thing is that this was foreseen.

The main issue was always that that LinkedIn post, even when prefaced by saying ""this information came from the discussions in r/NTU"" or something along those lines wasn't enough to shift the blame to Reddit's unhinged discussions but rather since it was accompanied with Nadine's opinions on future actions that might be able to be taken against Ethan based on those uncontrolled rumors (Ethan wanting to get a confession out of the victim, for example). With that, this lawsuit became scarily viable for Ethan to pursue because as difficult as it is to prove romantic feelings weren't involved in the court of law, it's also as difficult if not harder to prove that they were, especially considering Nadine's position as an NUS and not an NTU student, not even minding the possibility of being a SU student that might see or know people that have seen Ethan's behaviors.

But I want to stress that Ethan's public perception, which is also shared by me, is dogwater thanks to this lawsuit. I get it, Ethan is *probably* trying to recoup reputational and potential future loss of career fees, which unfortunately I think is fair as this post was directly put up on LinkedIn for a reason I presume. But not even giving her an option to just take down the post or settle things personally without immediately giving her a lawsuit threat is insanely scummy to me and probably a lot of you. Because it looks to us as if it's not Ethan trying to get back his lost career and reputation, it looks a lot like he's trying to cause the most damage to Nadine financially because he can.

What's happening to Nadine is insanely saddening and Ethan's a piece of crap, but I can only wonder that the reason this happened in the first place is due to the unsubstantiated accusations laid upon Ethan here on r/NTU under the guise of anonymity influencing Nadine's decision to put the LinkedIn post with those claims forward to begin with.

&#x200B;

Edit: Mods have restored Nadine's comment and it seems that the initial email was a warning letter. My point still stands, that's a scummy move, I don't think anyone would just fork over $100,000 without a fight or even apologize for something that at the time seemed like reasonable statements, which I *predict* is something Ethan's lawyers knew and sent the letter with that in mind (therefore pressuring her to fight and exhausting her finances).",153,0,,2023,10

7,Comment,17ap7t1,Ethan Ong pursues lawsuit against student for $100k,Unknown,2023-10-18 12:43:38+00:00,"Hi, this is Nadine - 

To clarify, I messed up the terminology the first time and mistakenly said I was being sued, when it was merely a Letter of Demand. Which is like a warning letter. After my lawyer responded, they said they would sue. And now they have mounted the /actual/ lawsuit. I apologize for not being able to respond to the comments from last time, because I was being PM'ed immense amounts of shit. Likewise, this time I'll be avoiding social media and just posting any updates on my IG. My Reddit DMs are closed. You can call me whatever you like, make rape and death threats, I heard it all the first time and I won't be even reading them this time.

I just want to mention here that I will not be setting up a GFM, I don't believe in taking money from people especially because many people reading this who've expressed willingness to donate are university students just like me, and that's just not the right thing to do imo. I don't want to take anybody's money. IF YOU SEE A GFM, IT IS NOT ME. 

At this stage, ""just apologize"" to Ethan is not going to work, because the lawsuit has commenced, and he may ask for damages, similar to the original Letter of Demand asking for $100k and for me to pay for a $7k advertising spot to post a public apology. That's really all I can say right now. At this point, no matter what happens, I have lost already, because I'll have to fork out money to defend against this. And it is my parents' money, which ramps up the guilt. 

Thanks for reading if you got this far. This is all I have to say.

ETA my response to someone below: I'm not trying to garner sympathy for myself by saying I have mental health issues, never have. I'm trying to say that I don't live at the bank where I can happy happy sign cheques to buy medication, fend off lawsuit, see specialists.

1)who is Nadine (literally and also in the sense like what position she holds, is she some random girl, is she holding president of some association to protect women, what is she)

2)why is she relevant to Ethan/NTU/the girl who got drunk

3)why LinkedIn


i have so, so many questions. i could be wrong (i hope i am) but i was quite bewildered to find out Nadine was some random girl not even present on the day of the incident, not even a friend of the girl, not even from the Student Union, not even from the actual school. i know there must be justice but going on your vigilante ways is bad advice. would've gotten more achieved by, i don't know, creating a GFM to sue him for the incident on the drunk girl's behalf or something. or forwarding a campaign to letter-write NTU to hell, IDK. all said and done, going to such lengths for someone you don't know (did she ask her to do this? i doubt but i don't know for sure) and getting this mess in return is simply not worth it. it's a good cause, but in terms of value, it's just not it. pretty dark but i'm willing to bet deep down at least a small part of Nadine wishes she never touched the issue in the first place.

Ethan does not need the money. Moreover, the linkedin post damages could, however it is improbable that it would amount to 100k. What he is trying to do is to teach nadine a lesson. Rightfully so, because she is no longer an adolescent, and the fact that she is studying law but does not know the consequences of her actions makes it worse. Yes, it is a power play from ethan. He knows it is highly unlikely she will be able to pay the amount he asked for. This also directs the attention away from the original alcohol inicident. 

At the end of the day, no matter how much of a scummy move this is, ethan did not break any law, however nadine did. All i can say is good luck and hopefully nadine learns from this and can find a donor somehow to save her.",30,0,,2023,10

(Looks at downvoted advice from before)

Sounds like she made the unwise decision of trying to fight it out instead of apologising unreservedly the initial LoD and suggesting a token sum to settle. If she had done that, he would have dropped case since it's not cheap for him either to proceed beyond LoD.

Girl ah girl, why you follow all the upvoted Redditor comments asking you to go and fight? Already warned that doing that was terrible unwise and would cause you to end up in a world of hurt. Those jokers who gave wrong advice can just delete comments (I see a lot of them already) or make new account.

Sorry but there is no chance you are winning this case, and 2 things are big knocks against you:

1, you are a year 2 lawyer, meaning you'll definitely be looked at by the judge as someone who should have known better.

2: all the ""helpful"" Redditors who so happily went to sound out how they thought Ethan was a douche *after* your LinkedIn post. Because all those ""helpful"" posts have became ammo for him: proof that his reputation had been damaged by you. Normally I'll advise you to ask these unhelpful helpful people to take down, but pointless by now as his lawyers would definitely have already captured.

What you can do now is just apologise unreservedly and offer a token sum of compensation (the price of the LoD, 1k maybe) and hope he has the mercy to stop the case. Stop listening to bad advice - it's not their money that's going to be lost. It's yours.",2,0,,2023,10

source: [https://www.psypost.org/2023/12/narcissists-may-engage-in-feminist-activism-to-satisfy-their-grandiose-tendencies-study-suggests-214994](https://www.psypost.org/2023/12/narcissists-may-engage-in-feminist-activism-to-satisfy-their-grandiose-tendencies-study-suggests-214994)

Except: ""A recent study has found that individuals with higher levels of narcissistic traits are more likely to be involved in feminist activism. This research suggests that for some, activism may serve not just as a platform for societal change, but also as a means to fulfill personal, egocentric needs. The findings have been published in Current Psychology.

The study was inspired by the idea that while many engage in activism for altruistic reasons or due to direct personal impact by the issues at hand, others might be motivated by less noble desires, such as the fulfillment of narcissistic needs. This notion aligns with the concept that activism can be used as a vehicle for individuals to achieve personal gains, such as attention, status, or fame.

‚ÄúBased on the results of a previous study, in which we investigated the relationship between dark personality traits (e.g., narcissism) and anti-sexual assault activism, we were interested to further explore the notion that some individuals may be involved in certain forms of activism (i.e., feminist activism) to (merely) **satisfy their own ego-focused needs (instead of prosocial goals)**,‚Äù explained study authors Ann Krispenz, a postdoctoral associate, and Professor Alex Bertrams, the head of the Division of Educational Psychology of the University of Bern.""",1,0,,2023,12

just a few points:

1. there is no way he will get 100k if he goes to trial. 100k lies within the range of defaming public figures like LKY and LHL. he is nowhere near a public figure, and im sure your lawyers have advised you accordingly.


2. his entire strat is very transparent - commence proceedings, make you incur expensive legal fees until you are desperate, and you have to settle on his terms. i leave that to your lawyers to advise, but at this stage you don't really have leverage to get a good deal. unless -


3. you plead defence of truth / justification / fair comment, and take out discovery application against him and ask for all the relevant documents to prove that whatever you are saying is true or fair comment. see the Rachel Wong defamation case against Olivia Wu, whereby Olivia got a discovery order for Rachel to disclose all her (among others) text messages to prove her infidelity. these documents will be part of the public record. put the allegations against him solely in issue before the court. but again, you should get your lawyers to advise you accordingly. 


legal fees can get very expensive and i hope you got a good and kind lawyer willing to do some low bono for you. all the best!

Such beliefs, conscious or subconscious, just keep one poor and resentful.

From what we see from the circumstances, Nadine is being hit by a lot of financial and mental troubles. Which at the very least is something Ethan *seems* to not have, at the very least financially. I find that extremely saddening, I don't want to see anyone get screwed over to the point of oblivion unless it's absolutely necessary and irredeemable, both for Nadine and Ethan.

Yeah, Nadine was kaypoh as an outsider, but I like to think the best of people. I like to think that she wrote the LinkedIn post not out of attention-seeking, but because the concerns from r/NTU genuinely seemed worth pointing out. Not out of ""I wanna destroy specifically this person's career"" but ""I don't want to see people that dismiss consent and sexually harass co-workers in positions of power."" Which is a noble cause, if not for the **misrepresentation of hearsay as facts**.

I don't only try to see the best in Nadine either, I also think that Ethan *probably* thought it would be a funny prank to get someone drunk, not knowing that the person would actually faint. It's the classic uni shenanigans that people get into while they're young, but it doesn't mean one shouldn't admit guilt and be defensive when it clearly violates grounds of consent (to consume alcohol).",4,0,,2023,10

If it's the latter, if people are seeing him in an even worse light because of this, doesn't that mean she is defaming him even more by posting these IG stories? Or is it okay for her to do this? Like did her lawyer advise her to post these?

He even apologised but the fact that he is suing for 100k is ridiculous. He make someone go drunk and he could have done something to that poor girl. People need to understand just because the girl was not sexually assaulted, doesn't mean he can go around making girls drunk. It could happened, hence possibly her reason for doxxing him since the student council covered up the incident. 

Eaten making that lawsuit of 100k is ridiculous. What, his entire life is destroyed? By the truth? Or because he simply thinks that everything is a joke? The girl told him so many times to give her water and he straight up give the girl alcohol. Like why would you do that?

Also that girl that exposed eaten ong should have been more prepared. She is a law student, obviously she should have known that the suing would come eventually. 

Now, in conclusion. I don't support doxxing. However, perhaps nothing can be brought to justice since the student council covered up the incident, which is my reason on why I believe she dox him eventually.  If I were the girl, I would made a 'police report' instead of doxxing someone's life.Are both in the wrong? Yes.

of course, there is always the risk that she will lose in court and thus having to pay money to ethan + costs + her own legal fees. but like i said, it can fairly be said that there is a fair chance that ethan will not get 100k. the figure is quite ridiculous. in the soh rui yong case, ashley liew was given 120k for *five* defamatory statements made by SRY (ie around 24k per statement). this one only got one, and ashley liew - being a former sportsman - is arguably more prominent than a mere NTU student. 

in fact, LHL got 100k (general damages) from leong sze hian. leong shared an article which stated that LHL was involved in the 1MDB scandal. is the statement made by nadine equally or more serious and grave than alleging that an actual sitting prime minister is corrupt?

But he can. It‚Äôs legally fine and accepted. People get other people drinking all the time, and got them drunk. Including girls to other girls. You want to make giving alcohol to people illegal?

1. you're going through a lot. no one should have to go through this. at this point, some things are not in your control. it could help to acknowledge the feelings re: burdening your parents financially. it is a valid feeling, but at this point, it's kind of not really your fault, and it sounds like you're a little hard on yourself for things you cannot fully control. 

2. getting off social media might help. please do reach out to a trusted professional (therapist/counsellor) if it's within your capacity to do so too. 

3. you will see this through. you will go on exchange and have fun overseas. 

4. people fund gfms not always out of pity, but solidarity, which is why some sgpns have paid for terry xu and roy ngerng. people will show up unconditionally out of solidarity if it turns out that a gfm is appropriate

That being said, there are better ways to do this when you're trying to save face or your reputation. I call back to the initial Letter of Demand, that demands Nadine hand over $100,000 regardless of her action to apologize and take down the post. That's where I'd say is going over the line, I think at the point where you commit to a public apology to the extent of big public news providers and the deletion of the initial LinkedIn post is where at the very least you can clear some things up efficiently.

Think about it this way, if this wasn't a method to scrape money or make an example out of someone by financially exhausting them and truly to protect himself from defamation then in Ethan's Letter of Demand it would have taken a more appropriate approach, linger the $100,000 if the demands aren't meant instead of enforcing it anyhow and invite for discussion. Theoretically this should be enough pressure for Nadine to care without coercing her into trying to fight back and incurring legal fees. Nadine at that point was his biggest third-party detractor, if he wants to clear up his name, an apology after discussions of the truths of the matter by that detractor would be more efficient at recovering his name, no?

Yes, people can consider the temporary reputational damages to be compensated via the enforced $100,000, but think of it down the line when this news becomes old news and Ethan pursues a career. In this case, investigations into Ethan's backgrounds would see that they were embroiled in controversy and the situation was subsequently rectified with what truly happened if he sought for discussion.

All that said, all this would be viable for Ethan... If he would've actually put up a proper apology instead of a corporatized statement on the Straits Times. So yeah, defending yourself? Fair play. Can I still say it's scummy with the methods involved? I can and think that my interpretation is just. 

You can disagree if you want, it's your opinion, you can defend it too with analysis, or not I'm not going to judge you, it's your life. I'm just adding to the discussion to try to add the grey perspective that it isn't one side is wrong the other is right, or which is more wrong than who, I'm trying to get people to understand that you can admit Ethan is not the best human being while also understanding how the lawsuit is fair even if it utilized what I'd call scummy practices.",16,0,,2023,10

It's a balanced view. I don't blame Ethan for using those tactics because that's really just how it is, and he was also in a very emotionally charged and even vulnerable state. For all you know, the lawyer might recommend these actions instead of taking his instructions.

I believe people like Nadine should not be let off so easily with just a slap on the wrist for the kind of damage she can do. It is ridiculous that people think it's OK or trivial that she did what she did. No one has imagined a scenario where they were accused of a crime they did not commit, and some random mentally ill girl makes a LinkedIn post that goes viral. Just a simple ""sorry"" and a few thousand dollars is not justice. But yes, $100,000 is ridiculous, but that was never my focus. As for the apology in the newspaper - I don't feel it's overboard. I've seen people put up apologies for trivial stuff. She is accusing him of being a sexual predator and criminal and has stated her intentions of threatening his future career. It's Ethan's right to ask for what makes him feel whole, and whether the judge agrees or not is another matter.",17,0,,2023,10

I don't really understand what you mean on apologies being overboard. If it's Nadine's I think that's fair play too, hell if Ethan wanted his reputation restored that's a great way to do so after one-on-one discussion on the facts.

If it's Ethan's, I thought it was just disingenuous ([this one](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ex-ntu-student-leader-apologises-for-alcohol-related-incident-involving-female-junior)). It feels so corporatized, it doesn't feel like an apology but an attempt at defense. I think that it was correct to reach out to the Straits, especially if the issue had blown up, but the wordings he used were robotic at best and didn't feel like an admission of guilt and a promise to do better, but as if he'd always been better and that he had done nothing wrong. 

Which I think as many of us here on the forum would say, inadvertently spiking someone is a gross violation of consent and obviously, something wrong. But as many of the non-radical ones on this forum also agree, isn't something to lose your career over, but definitely something to be punished for in some way (which never really happened apparently after the whole faux 5-week SU suspension fiasco).",4,0,,2023,10

Like if a child exhibits zero empty, takes delight in harming those weaker than him, has a particular liking for setting things on fire, can't take no for an answer, tries choking a peer etc those are extremely concerning things that can lead to serial killer behaviour. You don't just leave it be like NTU did. And if NTU is incapable of correcting this kind of behaviour (as they have repeatedly shown), someone else needs to step in. 

Besides, NTU is an organisation we give a significant amounts of money to. By your logic, we can't complain if NTU doesn't put the money towards building 10 more gardens and doesn't care about student wellbeing and teaching quality since it's ""not illegal""? 

To reduce his behaviour to the equivalent of cheating just shows how much you don't care about crime done on women and the events leading up to it. You keep saying you're not defending him but that's like 90% of what you use your account for. You don't want to go into whether or not his actions were correct, even though it is obviously wrong, and try to play the centrist. This isn't neutrality and objectivity. When you swing towards the middle even though the facts point to another side, it's just veering towards the side with less sound logic.

I wasn't trained in Singapore, so I won't comment about this situation or Singapore law. But we can see around the world when high-profile suits like these are instituted, people have to fight the war on multiple fronts. 

Of course, there's always the courtroom. But it's also very important how the public perceives a person. Take, for example, the double Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey. In late July this year, he was acquitted *by a jury* in England of multiple charges of sexual assault: [source](https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2023/jul/26/kevin-spacey-cleared-of-sexually-assaulting-four-men). However, this did not stop a London theatre from cancelling a movie premiere in which he stars only as a *voice actor* \- i.e. doesn't even appear on screen: [here](https://variety.com/2023/film/global/kevin-spacey-control-premiere-canceled-sexual-assault-trial-1235757051/). It was reported that the person who runs the location, Greg Lynn, said:

>‚ÄúLast night it came to our attention that your film features Kevin Spacey, in particular his first film since the court case,‚Äù Lynn continued. ‚Äú**My staff as well as I are horrified that we are being mentioned in the same breath as his new film for the premiere.**‚Äù

Obviously, we don't know exactly *why* this person was horrified. It could be for any number of reasons.

Why  do you think it is normal thing to assume a student who can afford law school fully funded by her parents cannot afford a 100k payment? Very weird for you to think this is normal, you must assume Singapore is a third world nation or something. 

> You can understand that a person can have average financial resources and not be destitute but also cannot afford to just pay 100k?

The average household can afford HDBs but cannot afford a measly 100k? You are clearly not keeping up with times. 100k isn't even the average annual household income, much less for her who is clearly living in an above average household.",1,0,,2023,10

She can at least afford that."" But hey if we want to not assume that she can pay school fees, then okay, she's obviously not well-to-do.

Yeah, she can drop out and pay that at least.

>We're talking about your assumption of her financial means. Not Ethan.

My point is nobody needs to assume anything. She defamed, she gotta pay the damages. You are claiming that it is a bad look to claim damages from someone who obviously cannot pay so he will get nothing in the end, but it is you who is doing the assumption here. 

She simply has gotta pay. Ethan can feel sorry for her and drop charges if she can't afford it, but he does not need to make any assumptions of her financial means like you are doing. 

> The average household income in Singapore is around 13k. A 100k payment is 8-9 months of salary and not a ""measly amount"". This means that the average Singapore family could afford Ethan's demand, by not eating for 9 months.

Sounds very affordable to me. If you can afford a HDB, you can afford that. I'm sure Ethan can work out an installment plan if that's what you need. But I guess not, since she straight up paid 5 figures for a lawyer while crying about how guilty she feels. 

You seem pretty lost on this, let's get you back on track:
1) She defamed. Now she has to pay damages.
2) You say it is unreasonable to make her pay damages and that he won't get anything from her because she is poor, but this baseless assumption on your part. 
3) She has not given any indication that she cannot afford anything. In fact she seems pretty intend in doubling down and going through with the lawsuit, showing no remorse.

So why is there a problem with him suing her and demanding damages again?",1,0,,2023,10

Uh what? Giving alcohol to a girl a year younger than you will ruin your livelihood? lmao?

Ethan is suing for damages alluding him to be a sexual assaulter. You are right she needs to pay him for damages for that. The figure is for the courts to decide. 

>The issue is not about Ethan's right to sue. It is about your original logic that she should ""just pay"". If she can't afford, she cannot ""just pay"". If the 100k is a ridiculous amount, she should not ""just pay"".

My original logic is she should just pay if she is not remorseful and unwilling to make amends. If she can't afford it, she should be looking for a way out. Clearly she can ""just pay"" since she is fighting the suit by lawyering up. No apology to be seen and she has already paid a 5 figure sum to lawyers already.

>""100k is spare change to her"" is completely your speculation. If she has to drop out of school or declare bankruptcy, it is obviously not spare change. Is something wrong with you, why are you suggesting two logically contradictory possibilities.

She already paid a 5 figure sum and is ready to pay more. She admitted that she has already lost, as she either has to pay Ethan 100k or pay her lawyers that amount. That doesn't seem to phase her much, all those financial worries you mentioned doesn't even exist in her mind.

You clearly insist that she cannot pay 100k. That is just hilariously wrong.   


Together with Nadine's apology you are entirely wrong about all of the above. And you gave sources that showed that you are wrong.   


>Ethan's position of leadership wrong - I said ""He was also in a position of authority"". The truth is he is in the executive committee of the student union.  
  
How is being in the executive committee of the student union any sort of authority?  


>the drunk's position of leadership wrong - I never said she was in a position of leadership, so yeah keep lying


So you wilfully ignored the fact that she is an exco member as well, therefore Ethan is in no power of authority over her? Lol? That's worse than lying, that's misleading. 



You also got the consequences wrong - you said ""nothing happened"". I said he got suspended. The truth is that yup he got suspended.  

Another attempt to mislead. A temporary stoppage of duties is of no consequence. With your logic, you can say he lost some sleep so something has happened to him. 


>Lol I don't ""think"" you got it wrong. You got it wrong. It's all in writing buddy.  

You are so wrong that you are also wrong that I got it wrong. 

  
>The ages. You said - ""Giving alcohol to a girl a year younger than you"". Obviously wrong. 

Fine, I apologise for that oversight. Are you going to fess up to all your other lies now?



>The position of leadership. 
You said - ""lmao, what authority does being part of the student union give you? Not to mention she is a union member as well. They have equal standing."". 

So what power does being in the exco give? Please answer this.

You keep repeating this but it still isn't true. The average Singapore can definitely afford damages up to 100k, even if they have to pay it off in parts. Also Nadine clearly is well above average as she paid 5 figures to secure the services of lawyers for this.

>Executive committee no position of authority? Lol right.

So what authority do they have? Please list it out.

She literally just ran for president, you can check out the election materials.Senior Junior what's next lmao? Why not just make it illegal for someone older to give someone younger alcohol?

If you are playing with semantics, you know you are wrong. There is no consequence is getting someone drunk, so whatever nonsense point you were alluding to is invalid. You still refuse to acknowledge this.

They're milking every UG student dry because everyone HAS TO pay union dues with no option of backing out and be considered not a member.

Which is funny, because even actual civil servants and public officers have a choice of whether they want to join the CSC (under NTUC) or AUSBE.",83,0,,2023,10

415,Comment,1793afr,Live from NTUSU AGM: Where our school fees are going into,throwaway-sotms,2023-10-17 03:06:35+00:00,"I think it's clear by now that NTUSU is a deeply unserious organization. I was honestly shocked at how low effort the whole goddamn presentation was;literally just recycling shots of the financial details coupled with some extremely boilerplate materials. Having been to various other clubs AGMs or Welcome Teas in the past, its honestly shocking how little was put into the presentation and the addressment of the issues at hand, simply coasting on the promise of free food.

Though one can say that the blame isn't entirely the fault of the students - its an open secret that NTU has simply used the SU as an additional source of manpower for some of its frontfacing public activities, instead of actually being a platform for student voices and other feedback loops. YET, the extremely sanctimonius attitude of the two persons they brought up as reps, coupled with their awful PR statements, just demonstrates the ability of this decayed institution to just attract or breed really appalling behavior. Aside from all the big talk about 'ooooh we will make our own legacy' (their words not mine), half their statements and details was just blowing smoke and playing deflection against the concerns of the crowd at large. Frankly, that was a masterclass in deflection. For those aspiring to be PR managers for any big corpo, take very good notes from these bunch. Like that SPMS guy was saying, they talked a lot of stuff, but even after almost a month's delay they still couldn't even give a concrete idea of what they were planning to address the issue. Sure, they may not have the final say in a lot of things, but are we supposed to help them figure this out? Aren't you guys our 'elected representatives'? Quit JAQing (Just Asking Questions) off and actually fix your problems!

Aside from that, the attitude of their 'direct superiors' is pretty disgusting. For those unaware after that SPMS guy finished talking they quickly brought in a prof to do some explaining (aka deflection) for them. IDK who that prof is, but for those under him, I feel you man, I've been some toxic situations and yet I've not seen such, well, passive aggressive toxicity as that. Its one thing to address rumors, but its another thing to go attempt gaslighting on a hundred 150 students in the room and tell them to ignore everything and trust 'in the community'. The 'community' that has zero sway in the grand scheme of things, the nebulous idea of a united student populace that only exists as a statistic and lacking in useful, student-driven leadership? ‰Ω†ËÄÅÂ§¥ÂºÄ‰ªÄ‰πàÁé©Á¨ë?

There was a few who were earnestly talking with the SU rep about making a more 'engaged' university community, like the Nantah of old - I'm sorry to burst your bubble but the days are long gone. The SU clearly doesn't have the interest nor the resources to conduct engagement of that level (again, acculmulated experience with smaller clubs), and more likely than not the University is likely to go 'my way or the highway'.",16,0,,2023,10

481,Post,17c1fu7,summary of the whole ntusu/üççeating ong saga,Ok_Trifle1130,2023-10-20 03:14:07+00:00,"I don‚Äôt side with anyone in this whole saga, however, I have been a casual observer enjoying all the popcorn and drama. Also waiting for the slow campus red.

Since there‚Äôs a lot of confusion with each new saga episode, I thought I‚Äôll list all the facts we‚Äôve gotten if anyone wants to catch up:

EPISODE 1: the original incident 
1. (As reported in every news media outlet out there, and acknowledged by the man himself) an SU small committee decided to have a bonding event where freshman junior got drunk. She and Raj requested for üçç to give water, but üçç secretly snuck a few glasses of alcohol pretending it was water. The other members saw and then proceeded to stop him when girl passed out in his room. A few of them stayed behind to ensure nothing more happens. 

So just to be clear, what was done crosses some grey boundaries, but there wasn‚Äôt SA or rape (the eyewitnesses have went to the media too). Even though there were allegations because SU was so hush hush about it. 

2. Apparently Raj told eyewitnesses to not tell the girl what happened and instructed the whole SU not to say also. I‚Äôve also heard sources from SU themselves that üçç went to show everyone photos of the girl being drunk/dizzy/toh-ed from drinking and was laughing about it the next day. Seems like he thought it was just a prank? Albeit not a well-executed one. 

3. üççkena 5 week suspension in SU, but heard from the AGM that this was meted out by Raj and üçç‚Äôs friend (not sure which one) so SU promises not to be so ‚Äúownself check ownself‚Äù in the future. Anyways you can argue that Eaten has already been punished but according to the news articles, the suspension wasn‚Äôt even adhered to properly because SU gave him more leadership opportunities during this time wow! This was why a lot of people were mad at SU btw. 

4. This incident was only reported at this time not because Ethan did anything explicitly illegal, but because SU being nepo SU, made sure he was the sole candidate running for President. 

This is valid bah. The President of NTU represents the school in front of the ministry and gives speeches on behalf of us, surely it can‚Äôt be a guy going around making girls drunk for pranks. 

EPISODE 2: Eaten‚Äôs rally

5. If you look at the SU email, the whole rally ended at 4 am because üçç‚Äôs qna was too long. Even if SU made sure he was the sole candidate, he still kena 20 against and 7 for votes, live-reported in WakeUpSingapore.

According to some rally-goers, Eaten also was called out for cancelling a committee event. Btw if you look at the Reddit post posting SU‚Äôs budget, the cancelled event (6/7k SGD) was still factored in lmao.

EPISODE 3: LAWSUIT!

6. This NUS girlie that no one knew made a LinkedIn post that speculated about his actions and alluded to his actions being SA even though it didn‚Äôt happen. 

Ethan has proceeded to sue her for 100K. He has every rights to prevent himself from being defamed, but people are angry that it‚Äôs a power-move because he didn‚Äôt give the girl a chance to delete and apologise, which even MPs do. 

Also the school gave him LOA just for this lawsuit to happen.

EPISODE 4: AGM (informal because never hit quota)


7. People are angry at three things: - SU takes union fees from everyone but the budget so sus and non-transparent
- SU ownself checks ownself
- Eaten and Raj both didn‚Äôt show up, when usually the previous batch turns up for the rally (+outgoing president speech was cancelled)

8. SPMS guy angy during QNA and stormed out because SU kept evading questions 

9. The profs were defending SU mad-hard so the girl from the alcohol incident used qna to call them out for it

EPISODE 5: other weird facts

10. In a Reddit post now removed by mods, Eaten was exposed for his history of dating a minor (15 years old). 

Since a lot of screenshots of his ex‚Äôs photos with him are circulating around, pls practise PDPA btw üò• 

He was also exposed for publishing homophobic content on his social media and for parking in handicapped parking lots in his hall. 

New updates as of this week: üçç edited his LinkedIn to remove parts that showed his involvement in SU during his suspension! Additionally, his ex archived posts with him before she was 16, but unarchived some posts after she was 16. Lawsuit preparation must be going strong! 

So yes that‚Äôs the not-so-brief summary of everything (proven) that happened. Have a good day.

Edit: if I missed out on anything please let me know! But make sure your statements are proven first, so we don‚Äôt confuse anymore people (which was what led to some false allegations in the first place)",428,55,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/17c1fu7/summary_of_the_whole_ntusueating_ong_saga/,2023,10

(1): According to the constitution by SU, part of the procedures for the disciplinary board states (and I quote from the formal document) ""The President shall nominate a member of the staff of the University to sit on the Disciplinary Committee to guide and advise the Committee in its deliberations.""  

However, this matter was kept internal by raj and not further escalated according to protocol, thereby breaching official SU rules. 

(2): Users here keep claiming that we are too invested in this saga and have to move on from this when the reason why people are so persistent is because we, and especially the victim, just hope that eaten will just apologise, admit that he is wrong, acknowledge the vulnerable situation he has put the victim in and show some remorse. Is it really so hard for both eaten and raj to just admit that they've misjudged their actions and apologise? If we allow people to ""just move on"", what kind of message does this send? That people can just go into hiding without reflecting on their wrongdoing and move on after the damage that they have caused?

2) There are 6-7 people at that gathering. Anyone else could have stepped in to help get her water or stop Ethan from giving her more. No one did, likely because of point 1, EVERYONE WAS DRINKING. How can someone who is equally as high gauge that the other person is at their limit? Self-responsibility people!!

3) The blacked-out girl likely did not get to that state of drunkedness from that 1 or 2 cup of fake water.

First, if he really thought anyone was going to agree to that ridiculous demand, he's not that bright.

Second, since he made a demand that was obviously going to be rejected, he forced his own hand into escalating.

Last, because of his escalation, he looks worse than ever. If his objective was to mitigate reputation damage, his actions have backfired on him.

A better demand would've been to request her to take down her post (as opposed to spending a large sum of money to make an apology in the newspapers). It'd be easier for her to comply.

628,Post,16zb8e7,Confessions of an ex-NTUSU Exco,gwynethtyt,2023-10-04 02:28:16+00:00,"\[Long post incoming!!!\] 

I was part of the NTU Students‚Äô Union 28th Executive Committee in AY2018/19 as the Corporate Communications Executive (Relations). I am here to share my story.

OK, now that I‚Äôve got your attention, this post is not about any particular individual or even a set of people. It is about the *NTU Students‚Äô Union* as an institution and mode of government.

I will not name anyone in this post because I know my peers would rather not be entangled in this matter, not to mention that they have moved on with their lives anyway. (Crucially, I am not interested in being SLAPPed with a lawsuit.) I‚Äôm only here because I‚Äôve been in NTU for longer than most people I know - first as an undergraduate and now as a graduate student.

This post is a singular reflection of *my* experience with the Students‚Äô Union: what I thought it *was*, what it *really* was then, what it *is* now, and what it *could* be.

Therefore, a confession of sorts, though I have nothing to be ashamed of, as you will see.

## What the Students‚Äô Union was to Me, Part 1: The Introduction

I was peripherally involved with Union activities in Year 1. I was a member-minion of the Open House Committee, and my task was to secure partnerships with external organisations. The Open House work was basic, but I enjoyed seeing the event coalesce via that invisible thread of camaraderie interlacing it. Through that opportunity, I met others, some of whom would eventually become my teammates in the 28th NTUSU Executive Committee (henceforth SU/Union and Exco).

When asked to consider running as an SU Exco member in Year 2, I was starry-eyed at the prospect. And why wouldn‚Äôt I be? It promised to be an avenue for me to create change as I envisioned it. And I *had* dreams: I wanted to revitalise the floundering Union magazine, U-Insight, and transform it into an avenue where students could express themselves. I wanted to improve the communication channels between SU and the student body, mainly so that student feedback, previously scattered across sources, could be consolidated into a single place to amplify its voice.

I had dreams, and I wanted to achieve them. The position of Relations Executive offered me just that; it gave me power - the ability to influence events in the direction of my will.

And who wouldn‚Äôt want that?

So off I went to the elections, full of hope and ambition.

## What the Students‚Äô Union was to Me, Part 2: The Election

Let me explain how the Union (Executive Committee) electoral process works. Again. Because I‚Äôve done this [before](https://u-insight.com/2018/10/25/what-is-ntusu/), but let me do it again.

The SU Executive Committee is not elected by the students. The Union *Council* is elected by the *students*. The Executive Committee is elected *by the Council*.

Some context is necessary.

Anyone who glances through the [NTUSU website](https://ntusu.org/) might think the Council is the Executive Committee. It is not.

The Council is composed of:

* The Executive Committee
* The Academic Constituent Clubs (a fancy way of saying ‚Äúschool clubs‚Äù) - e.g. School of Social Sciences Club, Biological Sciences Club. All students are part of the club whose name matches their school.
* The Non-Academic Constituent Clubs (i.e. the Big Three Clubs that seem to pervade every aspect of CCA life) - WSC, Sports Club, CAC. All students are members of ALL NACCs (bet you didn‚Äôt know that! And that‚Äôs why you can vote in their elections, even if you don‚Äôt participate in their activities or volunteer).

The power distribution within the NTUSU Council has baffled me, though certainly, I had no interest in pursuing the matter given that the arrangement benefited my position. How I understood it during my time was (might be inaccurate):

* The Council, as a totality, is concerned with all student members. They discuss things sporadically. The duration between successive meetings can span up to months.
* ACCs and NACCs are more concerned with things happening within their student sections. They primarily run events for their own members.
* Exco is concerned with all ‚Äú26,000 undergraduate students of NTU‚Äù and counting. They implement the decisions of the Council, kind of. They organise events for and represent everyone. They are the closest point of contact to the NTU management.

(If you‚Äôre wondering about the postgraduate students, they‚Äôre covered by another group entirely irrelevant to this discussion - the Graduate Students‚Äô Association \[GSA\]. There are also the non-constituent clubs, which are the smaller clubs catering to more specific interests.)

When I write about it that way, there seems to be an overlap between Council and Exco. Hmm. The Council makes some decisions, but the Exco makes others, though the Exco is responsible for most of the legwork. Another interesting factoid: the current Constitution says that the Council ‚Äúhas the power to‚Äù exercise control over the Executive Committee. I am not sure how it works in practice.

I digress. Back to the electoral process.

Again: The SU Executive Committee is not elected by the students. The Union *Council* is elected by the *students*. The Executive Committee is elected *by the Council*.

There are two ‚Äúlevels‚Äù of elections happening here.

* The first election, at the NACC/ACC level. Students vote here for the Committee Members *of their NACC/ACC Club.* This is what you vote for on Union Day. The President of the ACCs at this level - and only the President, not other committee members - becomes a Council Member. For NACCs, two (President and VP/Hon Gen) become Council Members.
* The second election, at the council level. Council members, empowered by students as representatives of their clubs, vote here to decide which specific council members become members of the *Executive Committee.*

In other words, students do *not* elect anyone in the Executive Committee. The *Presidents* of their Clubs do.

A more concrete example to illustrate - myself. Students elected me as the Union Representative of the School of Social Sciences, and I became a Council Member. (That, or at least a temporary member who could stand for elections in the Council. The definition of a Union Representative is wonky.) Then, I was voted in by the 28th Council Members to become a member of the Executive Committee. If by any chance the Union Rep is not elected due to lack of confidence or a contesting candidate winning, they are required to resign from the Council basically immediately. In case I get questions on this, yes, my role was uncontested.

I noticed a lot of fanfare on the ground over students being unable to directly elect the Exco. Note that this election process is neither unfair nor problematic per se. The Prime Minister of Singapore is chosen similarly. The Prime Minister is defined as the leader of the Parliament, and the leader is decided through a ‚Äúconsensus among peers‚Äù involved. The voting public has limited influence over the final decision of who is selected as the PM - though, of course, it can have its preferences, and its opinions are sought by the government. A Mothership video explains it better than me¬†[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2RQTB5Qq90)¬†(unfortunately).

By the way, I can‚Äôt find the past Students‚Äô Union Council Rally meeting minutes. The¬†[election archives](https://www.ntusu.org/election-archives)¬†(which I had to google to find and which doesn‚Äôt seem directly accessible from the main NTUSU website) only have the results of the ACC/NACC-level elections. If anyone can find the past Council meeting minutes, please leave a comment below, thanks. It is 5:51 a.m., and I am not in the headspace to search for gold in the desert.

## What the Students‚Äô Union really was: The Exco and its Jurisdiction

I learned following my successful election that there were limits to my power. To give some perspective, I guess my role at that time is the equivalent of the current Public Relations Executive in AY2022/23. I had to report to my Vice-President, who was accountable for my actions; they had to report to the President, who was accountable for *our* actions. The President, in turn, was accountable to stakeholders with various interests.

I don‚Äôt want or need to elaborate on how the Union is aligned vis-√†-vis the university management regarding decision-making. I am sure there are plenty of posts out there that can paint a picture for you. I *will* say that the Union is dedicated to protecting the peace of the status quo. This is hardly surprising; it would be surprising if it were anything else.

My role was mainly limited to communicator¬†*ex post facto*¬†rather than decision-maker, given the limits of my power. So I¬†*could*¬†consolidate feedback and¬†I¬†*could*¬†attempt to persuade, but I had no say in the final decisions made.

One of my first projects was consolidating feedback via Union channels. As I promised in my rally, mind you! The hot topic that year was the issue of being unable to see the results of your S/Ued options, unlike NUS‚Äôs practice.

Ultimately,¬†[this was the end result](https://u-insight.com/2018/10/25/what-is-ntusu/)¬†we communicated to students. Relevant extract copied below.

Context: the bolded sentence is a question asked by a student we received via our newly released feedback channel. We gathered recurring themes and officially responded to them via our editorial website, U-Insight (responses in point form below the question).

>**Why can‚Äôt we see our results before choosing to S/U it? What has NTUSU done regarding this issue? ‚Äì MECH/4**  
The University Management‚Äôs stance is that the S/U option is part of the broad level efforts undertaken by the University to nurture a holistic learning environment that puts less emphasis on grades and focuses more on learning and exploring courses beyond their core disciplinary studies. The University Management believes that the current S/U declaration period up to two working days after the last exam paper of the semester gives students sufficient time to weigh their choices of either opting for grade or S/U notation, rather than as a means to pull up their GPA \[‚Ä¶\]  
   In AY14/15, after hearing from students, NTUSU successfully pushed for the S/U option to be available after exams, when it was previously available only before exams. NTUSU is constantly engaging both students and the management on this matter.  
  

Note how the response is phrased. I leave the interpretation up to you, but I can tell you I oversaw its creation. By the way, the last sentence *is* true, even as it is broad. The point here is that students are given access to the *outcomes* of discussions involving the Students‚Äô Union. As for the *process,* which is fundamental to participatory decision-making‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs up to you to decide.

## What the Students‚Äô Union is, Now?

A few comments on the selection process based on my experience.

I was recruited due to my past experience as a member of a Union Committee before running for Executive. I believe this is a reasonable expectation to have for someone who is expected to represent the interests of students; aside from a desire to serve, it helps to have prior experience. But beyond demonstrating ability through your previous work, it is because you have made connections through your shared experiences.

‚ÄúConnections‚Äù sounds like a dirty word, huh? But is it really? We know elected positions in the Council and across clubs, halls, and societies are almost always uncontested. It is the rule, not the exception. People ask why, but there really is no question. The simple answer is that succession planning occurs. Imagine you are a leader of some club or society. You would hope to leave it in good hands. You are now faced with a decision. Who do you pick to succeed you?

We can argue that the system is flawed if, and only if,

(1) Students are *not* given an equal opportunity to run for these positions, AND/OR

(2) Students who *do* apply are *not* evaluated fairly.

It is hard to argue (2) because most positions are uncontested. So, we focus on (1).

Now for the million-dollar question: did (1) happen with the transition of power from the previous Union Executive Committee to the current one?

**I don‚Äôt know.** Neither do I want to make any claim with absolute certainty.

What we can do is to look at the information we‚Äôve been presented with, and you can decide for yourself.

## What the Students‚Äô Union Could Be?

Before evaluating what we have, consider this fascinating observation of mine.

The circle is closed, yes, but it is not impenetrable.

In the same Union Rally I attended to be elected, another position in the Exco was contested. Two people ran for it. One of them was unexpected. The unexpected one was dazzling in their purity, and I say that in the most respectful way possible. They had seen the club elections notice, and with pure hope, they had run for Union Rep, got elected by their students, and decided to run for the Exco with whatever they knew. Of course, the other candidate had done the same, but with a longer preparation runway. Only one of them was elected that night. Guess who won? You‚Äôd be surprised.

In the latest AY2023 Union Rally, the role of President was contested by the Union Rep of the Welfare Services Club. However, it seems that a technicality did not allow them to rally before the incumbent President was elected. Hmm... (It‚Äôs all reported on [Soapbox](http://soapbox.sg/2023/09/24/disgraced-former-ntusu-vice-president-out-of-union-presidential-bid-new-candidate-emerges/) \- not my words!)

These two examples are few and far between. Still, they are sufficient to establish that theoretically nothing stops students from running for elections, whether as Union Rep at the club level or Exco members at the Council level. Theoretically. Please do not take this to mean that I am defending the current state of affairs.

**The next question is: assuming students care enough to run (*****high bar in itself btw*****), do they** ***know*** **enough to run? If they do not know enough, can we argue that this results in unequal access?**

*Information Asymmetry, Example 1*

Let‚Äôs backtrack into the election process again.

I knew I had to be elected into the SSS Club as Union Rep to become an Exco member later. I knew this because I was familiar with the election procedure. And I knew this because I knew someone who knew this. Of course.

**I suspect that many students are not aware of this requirement.**

The above does *not* mean that students are ***not*** allowed to run in club elections. In my case, the SSS Club elections in my time were open to all, and people were free to run for whatever positions they desired (- I think!). There was at least an email informing people that applications were open. There was an open ‚Äúcandidate evaluation process‚Äù which consisted of them pasting applicants‚Äô entry forms onto big boards displayed in the foyer for passersby to gawk at. Was mine there too? I can‚Äôt remember - it‚Äôs been years. The devil may be in the details, but I don‚Äôt remember anything amiss.

But that‚Äôs missing the point.

*Information Asymmetry, Example 2*

Another thing I noticed is that the NTUSU Instagram page (managed by the Exco only, the Communications department in particular) does not list the names of the Union Representatives contesting for Exco positions. I chalked it up to lack of transparency *initially*, but on second thought, it makes sense in a pedantic way. The Union Reps have yet to officially hold any positions in the Council/Exco\*.\* So, there is *technically* no need to declare your interest in a specific Exco position until you get to the Council Rally, which is a closed-door event anyway. (This feels like the kind of argument phrasing that got the current SU PR department in hot soup.)

To be even more pedantic, one could argue that students have access to information regarding who their Union Reps are - you can find out via the results release of the elected positions via the ACC/NACC club documents. They‚Äôre just not widely publicised, so it takes a lot of effort to find out.

I repeat: information asymmetry.

Anyhoo, if we‚Äôre focusing on improvement, I would love to see more details of Union Reps interested in Exco positions being released by NTUSU moving forward. After all, if someone is going to represent my interest and that of 26,000 others, I feel like they deserve a certain level of public scrutiny and evaluation. Let me hear your pitch! Let me see your r√©sum√©!

**To summarise, one thing is clear: there is a gap between the current communication of the SU‚Äôs election/decision-making procedures and students‚Äô understanding of it.**

**The equation is simple: if students don‚Äôt know what to do or how to do it, they cannot do it.**

I would say both the Union and the students share a responsibility on this matter - the former for conveying information, and the latter for seeking information. But suppose I am right in assuming that a severe information asymmetry is present at the moment. In that case, the onus is on the SU (led by the Exco) to resolve it. (This post *is* an attempt to rebalance this asymmetry, but I am old and retired!)

## Conclusion: For Students, by a Student

Institutions - especially established ones - always tend towards inertia. There is little incentive to change what works if it has been working fine for the people who benefit most. But at some point, we will be knocked off our feet and then forced to recalibrate - who is this system benefiting? And if there is a discrepancy between what was promised and what is, how do we fix it? I can‚Äôt offer anything else more feasible, but I am genuinely encouraged to see that more students are challenging what we‚Äôre used to in hopes of something better. It may seem disingenuous for me to say this as someone who was part of ‚Äúthe establishment‚Äù, but after all‚Ä¶ the goal of the Students‚Äô Union was always to represent students‚Äô interests, right?

If you‚Äôve read this far - thanks, even if you skimmed everything. Here, I just want to share something personal. I didn‚Äôt know if I should post this or even start *writing* this. But acting almost on compulsion, I sat down at 2am in front of my laptop and started typing anyway. It is now 7:46am. I could not stop once I started. I guess I‚Äôve wanted to say something for a long time, and after a long while, the time has finally come. I just felt like I had to say something, and if I don't post this somehow I will regret it. Whatever it is, I hope students can continue to speak up on what matters to them.

P/S: If you think I‚Äôm doing this for attention - well, maybe. I could have posted this anonymously, but with the level of detail I went into, it was bound to be a matter of time before I was doxxed anyway. If there‚Äôs something in it for me (aside from more readers <3), I believe this post captures the transparency I wanted to achieve in my time in the NTUSU. Regardless, I hope there‚Äôs something that you can take away from this.

And those conclusions are for you to hold and act on, not me.

Final disclaimer: I tried my best to be accurate, but let me know if anything is false. I will revise my post, where reasonable, with credits to you. (Please don‚Äôt sue me.)

I ran for SU rep as a freshie last year. I passed round 1, and widthdrew a few days before round 2 because of the cummulating uncertainties. I didn't know how busy I would be academically. The exact details of exco commitments are also hard to gauge definitively. Furthermore, I was turned off by long rally times (i.e. round 2's runtime). It lasted hours (was projected for 9am - 2am).

Perhaps I was successfully filtered out. Perhaps the barriers to entry adequetely signalled the nature of the job.

Suppose SU became an ideal version of itself, i.e. trusted widely, direct democracy, transparent, open, engaged, &c. What would that accomplish? I'm jaded. As a student, I believe we're at the mercy of NTU admin. All the changes I want will never come from SU. I want hall capacity reforms, ICC curriculum reforms, open and transparent financial reporting, and so much more from NTU. The only way we'll ever get that is if NTU decides to do it themselves.",12,0,,2023,10

Despite this, both clubs have equal powers when electing SU Exco. This means that one NIE student has more voting power than one NBS student.

Did not know the S/U issue has been discussed since AY14/15. I do remember raising this same point in one of the senior management dialogues in AY 21/22 and was given a very passionate lecture on exactly what you have mentioned. I think it is just unfortunate that this message is passed through SU as the broker between both the student body and staff, which makes it seem like SU is, put bluntly, useless. 

Alot is behind what makes someone run for a position in the SU exco and the process is truly complicated for the uninitiated. That said i believe that majority of those who do have the best interests of the student body at heart and do so with the purest intentions initially, only to grow jaded in time. It is definitely not easy dealing with the powerlessness of being in office for less than a year and facing off with staff who have dealt with the same issues year after year after year, having been well prepared with well thought out reasonings that we know the student body will not buy, but yet failing to establish our own stance as one that is equally as convincing. Those who have managed to do so and have chosen to do again year after year truly have my respect, at least in this sense",3,0,,2023,10

653,Comment,16zb8e7,Confessions of an ex-NTUSU Exco,pornova,2023-10-04 04:57:19+00:00,"Let me try for OP (assuming I understand him correctly):

Pretend that NTU has an NBA team called NTU-NBA (i.e. Student Council).

To make it into the NTU-NBA team, you must become the Captain and/or VP of your high school team (i.e. President/VP of the Academic or Non-Academic Student Constituent Clubs - i.e. the ""council"" for specific schools or sports or welfare societies etc). People who don't make it into the high school teams got no chance to enter the NTU-NBA team.

The issue is that it is often hard to find information about tryouts for the high school teams and nepotism can also occur (i.e. outgoing captains telling their friends to try out for high school team positions while not openly publicizing that there are open roles or only putting out small flyers that roles are available). This, and the general disinterest in basketball, means that the system is essentially a ""closed-loop"" even though it is technically open to all to try out (since the outgoing captain probably has enough teammates/friends in high school to support him shutting you out of the team if you're not his friend).

In any case, assuming that you successfully enter your high school team and become Captain/VP, you then get into the NTU-NBA team.

The NTU-NBA team members will then vote on the first team players (i.e. Executive Council). Although other schools might hold an open tryout for first team players, the NTU-NBA team says that only their pre-existing team members should vote on the first team. The rationale is that the players are the ""best""/representatives of their high school, so they know which player their entire high school wants as the first team for NTU-NBA.

The entire vote is done behind closed doors and there is no information about who is even trying out for first team until the team is decided, which allows for backstage shenanigans to occur and makes the process for first-team admission very unclear to those outside of the NTU-NBA team.",11,0,,2023,10

The right thing to do was to go to the police if that person had felt what ""Joshua"" did was criminally offensive. Let the authorities do their investigations. But after 4 years? This reeks of vengeance. Posting entire privy conversation online is just... low?

It also makes me question your priorities on choosing not to talk about the actual content of the screenshots. Especially when some of the screenshots show him discussing how it would be like to have sex with his friend, when there are open confessions of him to criminal acts, and when there are screenshots coercing OP to be more open to sexual behavior? 

OP also said that part of the reason she had to be open with the evidence is because he plays word games and the reason things got this far is because she took too much of what he said on good faith, so to be honest, it's hard to take your stance as someone from SOH seriously since it could literally prove her point.",9,0,,2023,10

1. None of these actually clears OP‚Äôs name like she says the intent of them were. It focusses on ‚ÄúJoshua‚Äù‚Äôs actions during the relationship, before and after. She doesn‚Äôt address any allegations against herself, which, again, if you‚Äôre in SOH, you may have heard.   
2. OP‚Äôs screenshots are contentious in many ways and are often undemonstrative of her claims. Why would ‚ÄúJoshua‚Äù admit so openly to these acts if he‚Äôs not at least intending to change?   
I may be presenting things in bad faith, but it‚Äôs odd of op to be presenting ‚ÄúJoshua‚Äù as a male aggressor when he‚Äôs not even a man. That part is left out among any others. That‚Äôs all I have to say.

705,Comment,16yu9cd,Another guy taking upskirts,Yuucrux_,2023-10-04 13:10:23+00:00,"One thing she has pointed out is of him painting her as being abusive or difficult during the relationship, which I think is quite difficult for either side to disprove or prove, so I get why it is difficult for her to address the claim. On that regard, why has he been radio silent now if he has solid evidence of him abusing her?

Also I don't really think ""Joshua"" admitting to the claims counts for as much as you think. It does show that he is at least some level of aware that there is wrong doing, but it doesn't mean that they have been addressed in action. Maybe it's just my experiences, but I have seen people apologise and then go on to repeat mistakes in the same vein, or apologise to sooth things over.

As for the male aggressor role, I don't think he was presented as explicitly... male? And any gender can be sexually aggressive so presenting that as a masculine trait also doesn't really make sense imo

I think that the fact there's a police case ongoing at least demonstrates that OP and her friend is willing to put their actions where their words are, so I'm more inclined to believe their intent here. 

Whatever the truth is, I hope there will be actual justice",4,0,,2023,10
706,Comment,16yu9cd,Another guy taking upskirts,sohthinkabouthis,2023-10-04 13:55:30+00:00,"1. I believe this is the case too. But your > ""which I think is quite difficult for either side to disprove or prove"" would answer your own question. It kind of disproves the insinuation that he's great at optics and twisting the story when he's not even making an attempt here. If he's really intent on the narrative that she's the abuser, it would be a great time to even release a preliminary statement right now. But I guess he's no Eaten Ong.   

2. That's entirely true, but we can't really prove further repeats happened unless more allegations come out. The public court will already do its fair share of damning.   

3. To a generally unsympathetic public, he/him pronouns and the reposter casually calling him a ""guy taking upskirts"" brings to mind a certain image that you can't exactly deny. I'm using those to refer to ""Joshua"" since this convo is happening in public and I don't know your views on gender.   

4. I'm wishing them luck. As I said, I think them bringing it to the police is a good choice because that leaves us with the least amount of ""he said she said"". Bringing it to the public considering the muddy optics just seems very targeted and reactionary. It's not really like the SU case where a large organisation is working to cover up something heinous - it's more or less interpersonal back and forth that ended up way too public. Not a fan of giant callout docs since I think constructed narratives can form really quickly.

707,Comment,16yu9cd,Another guy taking upskirts,Yuucrux_,2023-10-04 14:21:26+00:00,"I see your points.

I guess with point 1 in particular I'm reading this situation as that because (I assume) OP has said nothing much up till recently that he has been given relatively free rein to say what he wants without consequence or need to prove any of his statements, on the sheer basis that people respect him alone.

I think that that influence should not be discounted, and it is likely very pressuring to be one person against what might be every person in the field/major he has spoken to, if he is genuinely as respected and known as she says he is. If he has established himself as a smart and understanding person, few people will likely even bother to reach out and ask her about her side since it's easy to be apathetic. 

As for my views on gender, I understand what you are saying, and this is an unfortunate consequence. But I still think it doesn't undermine the fact that what is put out on the screenshots seems, imo, contextually clear enough to be wrong. On their public instagram they have reposted some stories from a mutual friend(??) And there's a screenshot from that friend on him just expressing gross views about how taking pics of thighs are fine because they are not illegal, so this seems like it has occurred to multiple people already.

there‚Äôs a whole current of hate against Ethan for filing a defamation lawsuit against a NUS law student.

But what i don‚Äôt understand is whether the hate is directed towards Ethan as a person, or his actions of filing a lawsuit‚Ä¶. cos (as unpopular an opinion this is) it seems that his actions as seeking legal action for defamation seems kinda justifiable (if divorced from the whole Ethan ong persona).

Let us assume two things: 1) The school investigative committee did a proper job and Ethan really did not commit any sexual misconduct 2) Ethan‚Äôs offensive actions only consists of giving alcohol to a girl who was already badly intoxicated

wouldn‚Äôt it be a false statement to then assert that Ethan has committed sexual assault? as much as he had done morally ambiguous things, nothing seems to suggest full on sexual assault? 

Therefore, the NUS student who decided to accuse him of sexual assault, would be making a false statement no? which is a legitimate grounds for a defamatory lawsuit? Unless the NUS student can prove that (1) and (2) are false, then she might have crossed the line into defamatory territory? 

i‚Äôm rly unclear about this, i‚Äôm not trying to take Ethan‚Äôs side, i do think his actions are questionable, but i do think that we shouldn‚Äôt falsely attribute actions to people? what am I missing out here, there seems to be so many people who think Ethan has indeed committed sexual assault, but can someone please fill me in with the news or evidence or sth that backs up that claim?",205,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/17asvj6/can_someone_fill_me_in_on_the_whole_ethan_ong/,2023,10

This may call into question (1) but i looked at the linked post, and so far i haven‚Äôt seen proof that the investigative committee had not done a proper job? your link is to a post by you repeating the same claim ‚ÄúNTU is covering things up‚Äù with no reasoning or evidence as to why or how?

and as for (2), given that a claim for sexual assault requires positive arguments (i.e., direct evidence to show that sexual assault HAS occurred) rather than indirect arguments (i.e., evidence to show that it may be possible that sexual assault has occurred). It would thus still be a false statement to accuse sexual assault.

And about the idea that she didn‚Äôt accuse sexual assault i think after reading the screenshot of her post linked by someone else here, it seems quite clear that she did though? She literally quoted sexual harassment statistics and in the very next paragraph accused the NTUSU as enablers of Ethan to carry out such actions. 

lastly, i think it‚Äôs completely unwarranted for you to allege that date rape drugs were used based purely on a unknown amount of time the girl was out? it‚Äôs almost as bad as the NUS student‚Äôs claim, unless you‚Äôre telling me you have some insider info that allows u to know how long and how badly passed out the girl was, claiming date rape drugs is another baseless allegation no? 

I don‚Äôt think the two assumptions should be called into question merely because many people don‚Äôt believe them, that was the point of my post: since so many people don‚Äôt believe them, there must be very good reasons why! I‚Äôm just looking for what reasons people have.",1,0,,2023,10

I mentioned earlier that the reason why people don't believe them is because of the last few times they messed up and covered up their mistakes instead of trying to improve things, and the build-up of distrust just kept rolling over a few years. 

Besides, the mainstream media articles deliberately [minimised the gravity of the issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/6r1KMuXV5f) with misleading wording. You can read more about it in the linked post. Please read the stuff I linked in my previous comment too instead of skimming over it. Point is, even if there is no crime committed, it is still extremely inappropriate behaviour, and he should not be able to get this close to becoming president of the NTUSU without people contacting the media and posting on reddit. Can there be any more checks and balances to ensure this doesn't happen again? Can NTUSU be more accountable? These are the main questions everyone has been asking. 

Again, if he has truly done no wrong, why do they fear the prospect of investigation? If he truly has nothing to hide, what's there to fear about questioning? You can say no crime has been committed (not yet), but can you say he truly has done nothing dangerously close to the point of making everyone uncomfortable? Must we wait for crime to be committed before we stop it?",2,0,,2023,10

822,Post,17jvh9y,How to write a report (which nobody asked!),Jump_Hop_Step,2023-10-30 15:05:23+00:00,"Warning: Long post ahead.

Just graduated from NTU (don't ask the course). Only cracked how to write a good essay/report in year 3 sem 1 (by then any GPA increase will not be substantial). I have been contemplating whether to write this because I think you guys are taught how to write a report?

This post is more relevant for those doing FYP (with variations based on your college). But, I am sure it can be used for ICC also? (By now, you should be at least 3/4 done, assuming next week is submission). I want to write this because I believe not everyone is taught how to write an essay, and trust me, asking people to find out how... they may not even know what to research on in order to write a good piece. So I'll just take some time to write a guide for those who aren't sure about how to write reports. This is also **NOT** the only way to write, just a suggestion.

Edit: If say you have very strict word limits, like 1500 words or less, do still keep this structure. Just touch and go for everything.

If anyone would like, I can make revisions here based on your suggestions.

**Report formatting**: Abstract -> introduction -> background -> lit review -> research design/methods -> results -> discussion -> recommendation -> limitations -> future research -> conclusion.

Also please use **topic headings**  **and transition sentences** for your report!! These extra words helps a ton in organisation, I stand by it.

**Abstract + introduction:**

Write your abstract **last**. For an abstract, it is an entire summary of your report. Readers should be able to tell what your study is just by reading it. (What you should do to search for relevant articles, or if you have readings you need to do but no time

An introduction is different. You want to introduce your reader to a problem and get people's interest to read it. In here, you can write a super brief background or something interesting to introduce the reader to the problem (1-2 sentences max). Then, talk about it more (implications), solutions, and what you hope your report will achieve.

**Background:**

You want to provide some context to your study and you talk about the problems of the issue you are spotlighting. At the end, give a **transition statement (do NOT skimp on this)** which serves as a signaling device to tell the reader that you are moving on to the next section and what they can expect. E.g (background about a specific climate change issue and its implications)

**Literature review:**

This one, I argue, it's the **MOST** important part of your report. It is also the part where you'll bleed the most. As to how to write, you need to find sources that talks about your issue, but their studies have **gaps/limitations in them.** You'll need to nail this part because it forms the foundation for later.

To write, you introduce the paper and explain the study **briefly**. Cite a few more sources to support it (improve credibility through cross-referencing). Then, showcase its limitations, as these limitations is where a **research gap** will appear which you will **seek** to address.

So you go... source A says (blah blah blah). This is corroborated by (source B, C, D...). However, what this source did not say is...

One more thing, depending on your study, you may also want to put your **framework/theory** here. You'll be using it as a framework where your study will be based on.

**Research Design**

By adding a problem statement here, you are summarising all the limitations together in the previous section. (E.g., Thus my study seeks to... ) Then, bring out your Research Question (RQ)/hypotheses after that. **\*\*\*If it's too far down, you might wanna state it in your abstract/intro.**

Next up, state your purpose of study (that is, your target audience) and the methodology you will be using (surveys/ interviews/mix-methods). Explain and justify clearly **WHY** you want to use this method (advantages) here. Then, describe how you have gathered your data.

**Results**

Report your findings here. **DO NOT** explain anything.

**Discussion**

This is where you seek to discuss your survey findings.

Does it support your framework? Does it answer your RQ? How does your findings contribute to the literature?

This website [here](https://www.scribbr.com/dissertation/discussion/) will do a better explanation of what I want to say. Summarise, interpret, discuss.

**Recommendations**

You might want to suggest some recommendations based on your study findings.

**Limitations**

Acknowledge your limitations of your study. Since your study focuses on a narrow scope, there are bound to be some parts which fall outside of the purview of your report. Stating it is an acknowledgement to the reader that you are aware of its shortcomings and you understand the limits of what you're trying to study.

**Future research**

Based on the limitations that you have mentioned in your discussions/the previous section, briefly suggest what studies can be conducted which can complement your study.

**Conclusion**

Write third last. Sum everything up. What has your study achieved? Potential recommendations? You may wanna end with a call to action for effect.

**References**

922,Comment,1796n73,"""Sometime in the future we will be more accountable and transparent""",throwaway-sotms,2023-10-17 03:05:57+00:00,"I think it's clear by now that NTUSU is a deeply unserious organization. I was honestly shocked at how low effort the whole goddamn presentation was;literally just recycling shots of the financial details coupled with some extremely boilerplate materials. Having been to various other clubs AGMs or Welcome Teas in the past, its honestly shocking how little was put into the presentation and the addressment of the issues at hand, simply coasting on the promise of free food.

Though one can say that the blame isn't entirely the fault of the students - its an open secret that NTU has simply used the SU as an additional source of manpower for some of its frontfacing public activities, instead of actually being a platform for student voices and other feedback loops. YET, the extremely sanctimonius attitude of the two persons they brought up as reps, coupled with their awful PR statements, just demonstrates the ability of this decayed institution to just attract or breed really appalling behavior. Aside from all the big talk about 'ooooh we will make our own legacy' (their words not mine), half their statements and details was just blowing smoke and playing deflection against the concerns of the crowd at large. Frankly, that was a masterclass in deflection. For those aspiring to be PR managers for any big corpo, take very good notes from these bunch. Like that SPMS guy was saying, they talked a lot of stuff, but even after almost a month's delay they still couldn't even give a concrete idea of what they were planning to address the issue. Sure, they may not have the final say in a lot of things, but are we supposed to help them figure this out? Aren't you guys our 'elected representatives'? Quit JAQing (Just Asking Questions) off and actually fix your problems!

Aside from that, the attitude of their 'direct superiors' is pretty disgusting. For those unaware after that SPMS guy finished talking they quickly brought in a prof to do some explaining (aka deflection) for them. IDK who that prof is, but for those under him, I feel you man, I've been some toxic situations and yet I've not seen such, well, passive aggressive toxicity as that. Its one thing to address rumors, but its another thing to go attempt gaslighting on a hundred 150 students in the room and tell them to ignore everything and trust 'in the community'. The 'community' that has zero sway in the grand scheme of things, the nebulous idea of a united student populace that only exists as a statistic and lacking in useful, student-driven leadership? ‰Ω†ËÄÅÂ§¥ÂºÄ‰ªÄ‰πàÁé©Á¨ë?

There was a few who were earnestly talking with the SU rep about making a more 'engaged' university community, like the Nantah of old - I'm sorry to burst your bubble but the days are long gone. The SU clearly doesn't have the interest nor the resources to conduct engagement of that level (again, acculmulated experience with smaller clubs), and more likely than not the University is likely to go 'my way or the highway'.",8,0,,2023,10

For context, there was only three people who got voted out the whole rally‚Ä¶ eaten, this other girl who ran for sustainability executive, and kept quoting the previous executive‚Äôs name the whole time in her rally‚Ä¶ and this guy who ran for corporate liaison‚Ä¶ that guy literally only got one vote from the whole room‚Ä¶ pretty sure that even if all the union representatives were in kahoots, the academic club presidents could have garnered more than one vote‚Ä¶ 

I personally felt that each candidate won by their own merit, with each QnA being an hour long or more. I am quite impressed that each of them were able to stand in front of a whole room of people, get questioned with no break, and still maintain their composure‚Ä¶. It was not as if we were being nice to them.

Plus, about the friend group part, the union representatives seemed to be grilling each other during the qna so I can‚Äôt be sure whether they‚Äôre friends or putting up a whole show.

And I am very disappointed in you, being a fellow president, being privy to the facts that went down in the rally, and yet choosing to spread this misinformation amongst the public.

And before you call me some NTUSU sock puppet account, @interesting-guest768 you can just ask in the council tele group who I am, and I‚Äôll reveal my identity to you, because I can stand by my word because the rest of the presidents were present there, and this was what we saw.",-2,0,,2023,10

I wrote in to my prof about my health concerns these few weeks and she offered a 2-week extension for my essay. I had a meeting with her to confirm that this extension won‚Äôt affect my grades, as that was my main concern for agreeing to the extension. 

I submitted it on time, and have received an official grade via NTUlearn as of yesterday. 

But today, she said she‚Äôs going to knock me down a grade because ‚Äúit‚Äôs for moderation purposes. It‚Äôs not fair to students who scored lower than you but didn‚Äôt get the extension‚Äù 

I‚Äôm so confused. Before I write in to my school‚Äôs office, can I confirm if this is common practice? 

For those who were granted assignment extensions, were your marks impacted?

+ any advice for this issue will be greatly appreciated, because my grades are going to be knocked down a lot :( ",109,19,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/17f3x3a/can_i_be_penalised_for_an_assessment_extension/,2023,10

However, consider the following. If you write to the school's office, do you have evidence of your prof's supposed promise? Besides, even if the promise was proven, what's stopping your professor from just assigning you a lower grade? Grading is a highly subjective process and she can give the school a hundred reasons for grading you in a certain way. you can try writing in, but imo your case is really weak  


I personally would just take the L and move on, because a) she could have rejected the extension and b) she may be grading your other assignments for the mod or even future mods.",33,0,,2023,10

If a privilege that can steer the course of a student's action is promised and given, I believe that such a privilege cannot be revoked once said path has changed.

If the prof disagreed at the start or ""revoked"" the promise very early on, OP would have likely completed their assignment through their poor health. It was based on this promise that OP submitted their work within the new deadlines instead.

Especially in this case when said privilege is revoked AFTER the action is done.

1096,Post,176tbij,AGM in 3 days,depetir,2023-10-13 07:42:25+00:00,"How are we feeling guys? It's probably been a tough couple of weeks with assignments and midterms piling up. I understand a lot of us are busy but I feel it's important we bring attention to this again.

Three very important reasons: Investigation, Correction, and Accountability/Transparency ^(or ICAT for short if you want the ultimate TLDR).

1. **Lack of investigation** of the incident. I can't be the only one who feels the incident is simply covered up and tamped down with zero further elaboration. What actually happened and why does NTU refuse to elaborate further? In addition, the statements given to the press were deliberately vague and misleading (I'll elaborate on this if needed). All in all, the issue is unresolved and we do not want to wait for him continue doing the same thing to others.

2. **Lack of punishment or any sort of corrective action** on NTU's part, aside from a 5-week holiday that was not even enforced and ""verbal counselling"" telling him not to do it. No help offered to the victim at all too? 

Even if he claims he had no intent to do any other actions, is it remotely appropriate for an adult man to keep giving a female colleague alcohol to make her even more drunk? Let's call it what it is, **a gross overstepping of boundaries and serious misconduct**. 

3. **Lack of accoubtability and transparency in NTUSU** . After all of that fuss with the misconduct, we have yet to hear a peep from NTU. It has not yet been confirmed who was the one who wrote NTUSU's [statement](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxfZaAhRhbP/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) although there are rumors, but we do not need someone who protects people like this in the committee. Why do we keep voting for incapable leaders who commit and condone such misconducts to represent us? Why are we [unable to vote him out directly](https://reddit.com/r/NTU/s/9xgySl8HsL), and have to resort to posting on reddit for anything to happen? NTUSU is an opaque jar of stagnant water that allows all kinds of pests to fester, and it is time to mozzie wipeout.

I know we're all tired of hearing of this, and I am too. 

I'm tired of NTU and NTUSU school doing absolutely nothing to help us until the media gets involved (see also: the [NTU homeless incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ob9i4d/ntu_hall_allocation_outrage/)) (Is there nothing they can do right without us having to resort to contacting the media?). 

I'm tired of them resorting to childish and pointless bickering like creating shell accounts to try and ""turn the tide of the conversation"" (see also: [the uWave incident](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/lfxw2x/opinion_ntusu_attempted_to_slander_uwave_as_a/) and all the rumors they tried to spread this time).

based on my experience, i would say chances of me getting As for ICC mods and electives are higher compared to major-related modules. this also depends on cohort size. also, there are SUs and MOOCs to consider. 

some people would say take the easiest mod for electives while others say to take mods based on your preferences. whatever it is, just do the standard things of following rubrics, getting your friends to review your essay before submission, clarifying with profs etc.

* Best student of my high school
* Winner of the my high school internal math olympiad and also chemistry (2nd place)
* 20 (A+) in Math, English, Use of Computer, Philosophy and Descriptive Geometry
* 19 (A) in Physics and Physical Education
* Merit student (17+) during my high school and excellence student (19+) for the last two years of high school

Also, I participated in the first robot competition of my country, representing my high school. Also, participated in a two year summer math school at my local university. For extracurricular activities, I made a small family business (with my dad) that we made photography, videography and drone services for three years (3 years), studied musics for 4 years and I'm also a amateur astrophotographer (I have a small telescope and did astro-imaging).

1167,Comment,17i8pt3,how to do well in physics???,HUATjj,2023-10-28 10:51:01+00:00,"Heard from seniors that this is the worst module PH1011 they had ever taken in their first year. It is not that it's difficult, but it's because there are so many things going on all at once, less time to practice and not scoring well happens. 

I failed Quiz 1 and will fail Quiz 2 as well but I think we can still do well for finals considering there are 2 more lectures left and we can grind PYPs for 2 weeks for the next 4 weeks.

Reason for failing Quiz 2 despite failing Quiz 1 and had a wake up call:
1) Trying to catch up with Math Lectures and grinding for Math Midterm; neglected physics for 1 week
2) Carrying teammates for group project modules/presentation, another week of neglecting physics and math
3) Burnt out for one week
4) Bunch of quizzes and CC submissions, another week neglected

In total, I cramped 4 weeks worth of physics content in 2 days after the EG Quiz. The questions in Quiz 2 came out in Lecture Examples and past year quizzes but I couldn't remember them during the Quiz. It happens due to lack of practice.

I just got numb for not doing well in ph1011...which is why I seem normal to some people after the Quiz ended.",10,0,,2023,10

Some questions are kind of giveaway on what type of concept they want you to use. This come very naturally to me , but not for some of my friends, perhaps you can try with sorting out: with what is known, and which concept use these known info's and what other info can you derive from the questions.

My appraisal of ML4: as someone else pointed out, we're being taken advantage of, to boost ML4's reputation or KPI or something. There's just a huge mis-match between their idea of interdisciplinary, what will actually make us career ready as a cohort, and the grading scheme. 30% of a 2AU course is for a marketing/problem-solution, all in the span of 5-7 weeks. Seriously? What are they thinking? Proper marketing modules aren't like this. There is no standard, no baseline, nothing. It's just a mess.

The whole point of being an interdisciplinary group is to leverage on groups' specific skills. Do they think, by random allocation, that every group is equipped to deal with this project? There is no interdisciplinary going on, only a simulation of us in the future, if we get into a ""bad"" company, that forces us to do these kinda projects with our colleagues against our will.

The only beneficial thing from ML4 is our resume vmock thing. We can actually use it for internship applications that will happen in a few months. Nothing else will matter to us. Nothing else has prepared us for our careers. Maybe the mentor-interview would have helped some of us, but the entire capitaland segment + the horrible 5 year plan + career canvas is complete nonsense.

After doing CC's for two semesters, I realised that grading for cc's is very subjective and not much feedback is given regarding our submissions which means that there is no real room for improvement. Moreover, how are we to trust that profs actually fairly mark our papers when they give such less feedback. For those in CC7, you would know that some instructors are not professors and therefore their standards may be lower which raises the question about how subjective grades are as diff instructors would have a different interpretation of the rubrics.

It is called The Feline Prowess Evaluation: An Annual Odyssey to Renew Nine Lives

Firstly, the exams encompass a series of challenges designed to test a cat's agility, intelligence, and adaptability. These challenges might include navigating intricate obstacle courses, solving puzzles, and displaying their innate hunting instincts. Such tasks would not only serve as a means of assessment but also as a source of entertainment for the feline participants and their curious human counterparts.

Secondly, the exams could have a spiritual or mystical dimension, involving rituals that tap into the ethereal nature of a cat's nine lives. Perhaps, under the light of a full moon, cats would gather in a sacred place to commune with their feline ancestors, drawing on the wisdom of generations past. This mystical component would add a touch of magic to the exams, emphasizing the mystical connection between cats and the cosmic forces that govern their multiple lives.

Furthermore, the concept of annual exams for cats might also include a communal aspect, where feline communities come together to celebrate their shared existence. These gatherings could involve not only the formal evaluation of individual cats but also festivities, rituals, and ceremonies that reinforce the bonds between them. The communal aspect of the exams would underscore the interconnectedness of the feline world and highlight the importance of collective well-being.",29,0,,2023,11

And, Mr. Lu Khong De, a word of advice. If you‚Äôre still reminiscing on a chick after MORE THAN A YEAR that you only met for A FEW MINUTES, I shudder to think that that was your only exposure to females in this entire period. Why don‚Äôt you put yourself out there and meet new girls? I get that you may be shy, but such tactics, while good intentioned, are simply cringe.

Poor guy is going to get trolled so hard but reading the letter gives me mixed feelings. Don‚Äôt get me wrong but putting a letter for everyone to see feels too exaggerated. Bro could just post on his social media story but had to make a letter for EVERYONE WALKING BY  to see. Also the fact that he put his personal email so that everyone knows who he is is so weird. If anyone knows who the girl is, could you imagine how awkward it would have been for the girl who has to listen to all the rumours about her and this guy? 

Also this is not one letter, there are many more letters that this guy pasted all around the school buildings. People saying this is cute is honestly very upsetting because this guy did not consider how the girl might felt if she sees all this letters around the building. Sure the girl might feel flattered but would probably stay anonymous to prevent rumours from spreading out. 

Not trying to insult him but there are definitely better ways. This feels like an attention seeking letter. Him saying that he risked it to post this letter already tells you that he himself knows this is a bad idea as well.",7,0,,2023,11

Take mods that you are good at and aim to specialize in those.

Year 1 mods are mainly for you to find your strengths.

Next, overload on modules, assess your competition and drop out of core mods that have high amount of FTs or scholars during the add drop period.

Then go for exchange, take many pass fail modules and meet the minimum amount of AUs required for graduation. 

Always ask your friends and seniors for mid term papers two to three years ago. The professors usually reuse and recycle questions from there...

If competition is too steep, consider to take a study break and do an internship before recommencing your education.

But in all seriousness, this is worse than I previously saw in NTU. There were times when I would work from Saturday morning to Sunday evening where I end up hogging a certain spot. This is not in GAIA as it was still under construction when I was at NTU. But I would clean up once I go home. 

There were others who just left their things there like its their own home.

The communication bar is extremely low, especially in the sciences & engineering faculties which are dominated by profs and research staff from countries that teach English as a separate subject (but don‚Äôt teach other subjects in English).

Having said that, I‚Äôd ask you to consider lectures as introductions to the topic. You shouldn‚Äôt need to watch a lecture recording. Attend the lecture and seek clarifications on the spot or after class. That‚Äôs a skill you‚Äôll need to develop to succeed in life anyway.",10,0,,2023,11

The professor's KPI is largely dependent on his research rather than how well his students score for their exams.

The downside is - they get overworked (3-4x more teaching hours) and are unable to link the material to cutting edge research or to advances in industry. So they‚Äôre best suited for 1st year and some foundational 2nd year courses.

Talked to the prof/ic of student provost after the first AGM and he said the reason for building yunnan garden and gaia over more helpful facilities like halls is ""birth rate"", as if ntu does not actively take in international students to fill the gap and students aren't constantly fighting for hall, and mrt will cause less people to stay hall (as if it wouldn't take east siders 2 hours to get to ntu still). Also said stupid stuff like ""hindsight is always 20/20"" like bruh the school is probably a multi million corporation by now, how are you guys not able to forsee something as simple as ""build white elephant that no one is going to use with student and taxpayer money and people will complain it is useless"" ?",56,0,,2023,11

Rankings are not based on whether things are done in accordance with international norms. They only look at the outcome. To improve or keep the ranking, i.e., to achieve certain outcomes, one needs to implement measures in a way that fits the local culture. I don't think the previous president was good at this. A local president knows the local culture better and could be more effective. ('Effective' doesn't mean ‚Äògood' or 'normal', things could be done in a nasty or objectionable way.)

I think the main factor in the drop of ranking is an exodus in the engineering departments. Engineering and medicine contribute a lot to the ranking because of high-impact publications. I don't know the exact reason of the exodus, but, arguably it can be attributed to the president's ineffectiveness to retain good scholars.",2,0,,2023,11

1. Man's still haven't answered my question on where is the leadership quality in the metrics and methodology cuz try as I might I can't find it.
2. Look at the scoreboard that NTU score's p low in directly. All these are factors that are under the influence of the previous president, not current. Employer reputation, employment outcome, faculty to student ratio. All these are thanks to the previous president, not current, and it has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with singaporean or american scientist.

I just want to know whether it is just me or are sg sellers are sometimes rude.

There's this caifan at a hall in front of my hall that I really like, I'm talking about going there everyday for dinner. Their food is bussing. It's also one of the most  popular caifan in ntu, given that a lot of people would always queue and form a long train.

Anyway, I asked the uncle for a vegetable (and since I don't know the word in mandarin, I showed him a picture of it from my phone, asking if it's available) but I think he got pissed and said no free no free thinking I wasn't gonna pay 

The other day I came back and the uncle was already side eyeing me while I was queuing. When it was my turn I picked my stuff and he immediately closed my dabao container. I pointed at one more stuff to add but he was so pissed he immediately said you, everytime, and I nearly cried man

I mean, it's my fav caifan but I now have to boycott cuz I dont want to be cursed at again, and I'm also sad that I can no longer have my fav food...

This goes without saying that I don't think all sg sellers are rude. There's this auntie from quad miniwok that is super nice and always smile despite me asking for special order all the time (no sugar).

569,Comment,17v3ac6,Why are people so rude?,Lost_Process_1969,2023-11-14 20:06:32+00:00,"Very often the underlying reason why f&b sellers get annoyed at a slow customer when there's a long queue is because they feel pressured when they have to keep the customers behind waiting. 

Sometimes they have to deal with difficult and entitled customers that complain about the wait so they try their best to avoid it. And it looks very bad for the uncle when people start looking to see why the queue isn't moving

There's a subconscious time limit that will trigger their annoyance. 

Try your best to get a look at the dishes available before it's your turn and prepare to say what u want. As the uncle is in the middle of scooping the dish proceed to point out the next dish and so on.

Hope this perspective helps.",8,0,,2023,11

The rest of the LPT are as follows. It will make the uncle's life easier.

LPT#2: If you dont see it displayed, it means they dont have it. Don't ask anything more.

LPT#3: if you know what the dish's/ingredient name is, call it out or else use the universal zhe ge na ge and point. mentally organise the dishes into columns and point at the closest approximate column. If there a glass partition, point at the bottom to indicate you want the dish closest to you, so on and so forth.

LPT#4: mentally organise what you want and order from the dish nearest to the rice bucket in sequence to the dish nearest to the cashier to avoid making the uncle walk here walk there. In essence start with the dish furthest from the cashier and end with the dish nearest to the cashier.

LPT#5: once you're done with the last dish immediately tell the uncle what gravy you want or no gravy. If you want gravy on your rice first, tell the uncle when he is scooping your rice.

It will take some getting used to our SG caifan style but keep working on it you'll be a pro at it soon enough. Make the uncle's life easy and you may find an extra piece of vege or meat someday.",5,0,,2023,11

I remember a drink stall aunty from the canteen near SPMS a few years back, and she was somehow in a perpetual state of grumpiness; I personally got chewed out a couple of times.  


It's a bit of a conundrum for me. I think what she did was wrong, and it's definitely possible to escalate the matter. I didn't do that, since I couldn't ensure that her livelihood wouldn't be jeopardised as a result. On top of that, I wasn't affected too much by her behaviour. I guess most students feel the same way, and that's probably why such things go unpunished.   


I don't think it's worth the mental anguish to patronise the stall you mentioned, no matter how good their food is. But on the bright side, there are plenty of other stalls on the school campus serving splendid cuisine that caters to your gastronomical whims. Fortune favours our bellies!",2,0,,2023,11

Who is the clown that called for such vote when the outcome is obvious, it would make their job easier and they can do anything they want? And the money comes from OUR SCHOOL FEES. Therefore, there shouldn't even be a vote to decide whether to release the budget or not, IT SHOULD BE RELEASED.

Why did the current president, Annabel Lim Shunhui allow this to happen under her watch? What does she have to hide?

Do you see parliament voting if they should release the budget for the country or not? By default there shouldn't even be a vote because the money is TAXPAYER MONEY. It is OUR MONEY and they do not get to decide if it should be released or not.

Do you see listed companies voting if they should release their financial statements or not? Yes, it is the law that requires them to release the financial statements BECAUSE IT IS COMMON SENSE, SHAREHOLDER FUNDS are utilised and shareholders are ENTITLED to know how their money is being used, not because the company VOTED to release them.

Same thing here, OUR SCHOOL FEES, OUR MONEY, there shouldn't be a vote, unless they have something to hide.

I disagree. Because you're equating it to the fact that people were protesting and pushing for change. I'd argue it was due to the government angling for votes. They repeal a law that wasn't exercised and the shrine the definition of marriage by law. It's the same wolf under a different sheep's clothing.

You see, demanding to do better is dependant on the society. There's no one thing that has no drawbacks. For instant, repealing of 377A, many people claim it's the first step. However, the second and third step are going to incur a lot more pushback from other communities. Our government doesn't do whats morally correct, it does what satisfies most people. That's the basis of politics. The LGBTQ community will get equal right as the older more conservative population dies off and the younger more liberal population takes over. That's why decades will be needed. The ""protests"" here are virtually useless as they are government permission in the first place. Don't get it conflated. 

>not holding the gov or ntu to the same standard

Oh but it absolutely does. You see a flaw in the SU. I'm telling you that the flaw is apparent in higher echelons as well. Pushing for change in the SU and not the higher levels does make you a hypocrite.

And in any case, even if the SU bare their books, like I explained previously, its an exercise in futility. Everyone including NTU knows of the shady nature of it.",0,0,,2023,11

Voicing it on social media, raising issues at public or closed door forums, are those not opportunities to seek change? 

And i dont think we are hypocrites bc who says those who are upset w SU and also upset at the gov don't try to take action? It can be smth as small as not voting for the PAP but that makes a change. And js bc ppl are unhappy with what the SU are doing doesnt mean they have to be unhappy w the gov/upper echlons?

I think we can agree to disagree on some matters but I stand by my point that just because you are content living in a miserable society does not mean the rest of us shld js stfu and join the grind for the next 40 years or so, nor should you shit on ppl for demanding change js bc YOU think it's useless",2,0,,2023,11

I think love is amazing, so don't rush just to find one, instead take ur time to find the right one and settle for a date. 

Based on my experience, I rushed to get a 'date', simply because everyone around me was getting attached as well. And then after that experience, I realised that i should take things slow and not have this expectation that getting a partner means your life will be all flowly and beautiful. I think you should stop comparing yourself to the others because it will only hurt yourself.

832,Comment,17lmzo0,Everyone is attached,noavocadosmoothies,2023-11-04 12:38:13+00:00,"I‚Äôm a girl in an engineering course, one with probably the most extreme m:f ratios out there. I‚Äôm attached to my partner who is from another engineering course that is less male dominated but not at 50:50 yet.

I don‚Äôt think this is exactly related to how hard it is ‚Äòto meet a nice girl‚Äô but I would like to shed some light from the female perspective which can hopefully improve your chances of finding your match.

I saw another comment earlier about desperate guys and I completely agree. Approaching girls solely with the intent to date them is a major turn off, and I promise girls can sniff it out from miles away. I‚Äôm talking only about IRL organic interactions. Online dating is different because it‚Äôs a mutual agreement that both of you are seeking for something more.

IRL, it‚Äôs about making connections between humans. IMO close organic relationships of any kind should always start off as friendships, where you value them as a person and enjoy their company. When you view girls only as a potential partner, it‚Äôs as good as telling them that you‚Äôre not interested in them for who they are as a person, which is quite contradictory to your agenda of finding a partner. Your partner should be someone you like as a person first and foremost. By person I mean their character, personality, values, outlook on life etc.

I‚Äôll explain why it‚Äôs a turn off for girls if you approach them in a day to day context (school, cca, not at (night)clubs ygwim) just to find a GF:
1. When they reciprocate your efforts to get to know them, they are doing it in the capacity of a friend. You‚Äôre abusing their trust in you that you have no other personal agenda
2. They aren‚Äôt worthy enough to befriend, their only value to you is that they can be a potential GF. That‚Äôs straight up disrespectful.

What I‚Äôve mentioned are for guys who approach girls with the sole purpose of dating them!!! Not necessarily saying that this is the case for you. I‚Äôve personally been through multiple of such instances and it‚Äôs dehumanising. I also don‚Äôt speak for all girls but I‚Äôm certain a large majority of them agree.

I think that as long as you‚Äôre genuine in meeting new people and making friends, and truly want to know them on a personal level, you will find a special someone who can connect with you romantically. Work on yourself, be kind, be sincere, carry yourself with dignity. Also, putting yourself out there to meet new people ‚â† shooting your shot everywhere. That indicates low self-respect and is also a turn off.

The reason why I started dating my partner was because he was first a genuine friend to me and we slowly figured that we could be more than friends. 

There‚Äôs someone for you out there! Think positively, channel good energy. If you‚Äôre constantly thinking negatively of yourself/love life, chances are that it will show in your mannerisms and hinder your love life even further. 

Hope this helps :-) Didn‚Äôt mean for this to be so naggy (or maybe cliche) oops",9,0,,2023,11

i think it works both ways where both the girl and guy has to be seeking a rs. its not rly up to the guy to rizz the girl into wanting a rs with him. but idt most ppl can expend the effort needed to meet the standards both straight genders are having nowadays WHILE staying afloat in studies esply in engineering",3,0,,2023,11

That's quite insulting to the girl because it feels like she's replaceable and interchangeable with anyone else yknow? Be kind and genuine and true to yourself. Also don't be the kind of dude who doesn't shower (absolute L), most girls dont care if you dont look like a kpop star but will run away from bad smell no matter how good you look. 

(Also imo too many guys look unflattering in uniqlo crew neck airism shirts (they look saggy sometimes.....) so if you want to stand out a bit more it might help to wear something else with collar or v-neck (not as important as the first two but yknow.....my personal gripe with the lack of self grooming in many dudes sometimes))

Also, based on my small sample size of my own circle of friends, girls in humanities and arts don't seem as ""direct"" as the stem girls so they will not be very fond of the ""Áõ¥Áî∑"" type of dude who doesnt get subtexts or hints or are not super romantic. Might just be my circle of friends but i like how direct stem girls are with what they think (even as a girl i cant get what people are hinting at sometimes), although all girls will appreciate a man who's empathetic and attentive.

Not everyone who's nice needs to be a boyfriend, that is the bare minimum. It's fruatrating how dudes fall for any girl and put her in the relationship-zone before she even gets to decide. You think it's bad to be friendzoned, but it's worse to be relationship-zoned by a guy who may or may not become obsessive and a danger to you or something, and he only sees your worth as a potential gf (an accessory to him even).",3,0,,2023,11

I did say it depends if your character allows too, doesn't mean you have to step out of your comfort zone to fit someone.

Yeah for the last part I don't really agree, I'm definitely a below average looks, girlS still try to start a convo with me üòÑ some are just genuinely nice, they ask me how the test was and about school stuff, which is fine cos tbh I don't know them well enuf for them to ask anything else lol

And also, if girls never take the initiative and you won't open up ü§î doesn't that mean you just don't want to get to know nice girls üôÉ I'm not judging you, I feel the same way too, I really do enjoy the lack of contact with people ü§£

In summary, if you're introverted and you want to meet 'nice girls' you really have to step out of your zone.

Like if she's sad she'll prefer if you hear her out instead of immediately volunteering a solution, that kind of thing. What you're showing is being sensitive, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but if a girl started crying during volunteering I will be confused too so it's not really a gendered thing imo. It's heartwarming that you care so much for them but there's always more chances to help more people in the future. Always good to think more positively! 

I'm sure there will always be people who appreciate you for yourself, I used to think it was impossible but here I am now.

I was also from poly. 

Heavy theoretical training allows you to see things from certain POVs that people who only received practical training cannot. If you ever have the chance to interact with the best engineers in their respective domains, like R&D heads, PEs, principal engineers, u will soon find out that they are learned in both theory and practical. If u want to be the best engineer, theory and practice are actually hand in hand, u cannot have one without the other if u want to be the very best. 

Hence on a personal level, I do appreciate the emphasis on theoretical technical training that I receive in NTU, as compared to say, a degree from SIT. There are merits and demerits to both ways of training. Personally I also think that you do not need to learn practical training in school, its easy to always pick it up yourself anytime, even GPT can teach u everything that u want to know about the practical world in an instant. But try asking GPT the hardest theoretical engineering questions and watch it struggle. If u think that theoretical training is useless, then it will be useless. But if u put it to use and use it to see the world through a different lens, then I think new perspectives will open up to you. 

Although I think that‚Äôs beside the point of the main topic at hand on this thread ‚Ä¶",13,0,,2023,11

The Omnibus app will say the bus is arriving in 8 minutes but doesn‚Äôt move for the next 10 minutes, which leads to too many people waiting for one bus. 

The intervals of the buses are also HORRENDOUS. There often are like 2 buses 5 minute apart from each other, which makes the waiting time almost 20 minutes when you miss the 2nd bus. 

Why are there only 2 buses in operation during the evening peak hour? The waiting times and crowds are terrible at places such as Gaia and NIE, and sometimes I wait for 2-3 buses only to not be able to board because people have bad bus etiquette and cut the queue to board the before letting people alight. 

It really does seem like NTU does not care for the welfare of its student after enrolment but prioritises impression management to the general public and only addresses problems when they become a huge PR issue.

1. Companies usually need a masters only for higher level positions because basic roles can be filled by people with bachelors at a lower salary.
2. Unfortunately, higher level positions require a lot more experience, something a fresh grad wouldnt have. 

That‚Äôs why usually people take masters only after a few years of working. Suggest you try for basic positions first at a bachelor‚Äôs pay, then jump to another company that are willing to hire masters grads who have some experience.",102,0,,2023,11

at this point even if students leave much earlier to wait for bus they are still going to be late because the app shows bus timings of buses that are off service, and having 0-1 buses in loop during exam period is just crazy

The Special Services Map is also attached for those who are coming to NTU from home

(I will be discontinuing the map for the All-Day Services, as the [official NTU map](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/images/default-source/life-at-ntu/transport/shuttle-bus/ntu-internal-shuttle-bus-network_sep-2023.jpg?sfvrsn=dbabb96d_0) has become very comprehensive bar the absence of 179A, and would more than suffice for virtually all purposes outside the exam period)

Do take note of the following:

* Walking directions are shown only for venues at residential precincts
* For North and South Spines, the venues are grouped by block number (N1, S3, SS4 etc.) due to the large number of venues in these buildings
* Only buildings with exam venues inside are shown as landmarks, except Fullerton Health (because üòâ)
* CWR (Brown) route is not reflected as the service does not operate on weekdays. All other routes which run on weekdays are shown; do take note of 179A operating hours

Also, a tip for those who prefer a more geographically accurate visual: the [PDF document](https://entuedu.sharepoint.com/sites/Student/dept/sasd/oas/Shared%20Documents/Forms/display.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FStudent%2Fdept%2Fsasd%2Foas%2FShared%20Documents%2FExamAndAssessment%2FExam%2FExamination%5Fvenues%5Fand%5Flocations%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FStudent%2Fdept%2Fsasd%2Foas%2FShared%20Documents%2FExamAndAssessment%2FExam) for Examination Venues & Locations on the student intranet is now helpfully hyperlinked, and clicking on the link will bring you to NTU Maps directly.

Lastly, the usual disclaimer: **while I have ensured that the information provided in the map is as accurate as possible, this map is an unofficial production and should be used with discretion and at your own risk. Always verify your exam venue at** [maps.ntu.edu.sg](https://maps.ntu.edu.sg)**.** All the best and hang in there! üí™üèº",12,0,,2023,11

1283,Post,181yewx,Test and Quiz ethics,Unknown,2023-11-23 10:33:59+00:00,"I am in year 1 economics. Before my recess week, I had a mid term test (30%). The test was held in the lecture theatre. The LT was very full and everyone was siting beside each other. Also, we were told to bring our OWN foolscap paper (imagine bringing your own notes)

After the quiz, the professor started collecting our papers, and everyone started passing down theirs.

However, the professor started going through the questions, in the midst of everyone still passing their papers down the rows. The answers were even shown on the screen.

As I was sitting near the back row, I noticed that a few row of students were still WRITING. They were in fact copying the answers from the screen and changing their answers, even after time was up.

The professor continued to go through all the answers for a good 5-10 minutes.

I don't know if this is the norm in Singapore as that was one of my first test in NTU. I come from Korea and exams are very strict. We are not allowed to communicate even after the paper is done or even when collecting the papers. Our bags are placed outside the classrooms even for the most minor tests.

Is this how it should be? Should students be allowed to sit so close to one another without proper invigilation  (the LT is so big)? Should the professor go through answers right after the test? Should students be allowed to change their answers after the time is up?

This paper is worth 30% of our grade. Is this fair?

Is my exam this week going to be like this as well? Us sitting in the halls together

What should I do? I don't know if it is too late to report, this happened the week before recess week and it is now finals.

UPDATE:

The issue was reported beforehand, but the conclusion was ""No evidence because the lecture doesn't have cctv""

No other information was passed down nor was there anything done to prevent this from happening again",125,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/181yewx/test_and_quiz_ethics/,2023,11

Felt pretty uneasy with the post because people have went to the AGM and all that effort was for nothing, and it sounded like ""has no one tried anything?"" but if you had gone to the agm, you would know how much of a smokefest it was. People can ask the clearest questions but they will try and dodge it anyways.

Communicate with the school in an honest discussion? Of couse people have done that. They can send whistleblowing forms and letters and emails to NTU but the administration decided to hide behind the SU (which does not have any administrative power) instead and straight up told them they will not communicate with them. (see: [ntu financial aid friends](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxDOb15v3H_/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==))

The result? No response apart from when the media is involved. If you have kept up with all the posts (i understand if you dont read everything, but it's equally hurtful to see people thinking no one has tried anything) you will see that people are basically forced to contact the media when they really need a reply and NTU simply does not care.

lately ive been feeling like im stuck with studying and sleeping/resting. studying takes literally everything out of me, to the point whr by the end of the day i just do not have it in me at all to socialise. my interests arent v conventional like football or kpop or tiktok trends or stuff like that. im more into nature and mental health, so its even harder to connect with ppl. its not that i dont want to meet new ppl, in fact quite the opposite. but i seem to keep getting stuck at dead ends of small talking. like ""oh how was ur wk"", ""whens ur next quiz"" liddat. i feel like im expected to always be this jovial, cheery, good vibes only guy who never brings his emotions into conversations bcos it would ruin the mood. otherwise ppl dont rly want u arnd. but if in order to hang out with ppl i always have to pretend thrs nth wrong besides the usual uni stress, then its incredibly draining cos i'll just have to keep masking, which makes it harder to motivate myself to socialise.

so im starting to believe i just have to grit my teeth and make it thru uni without socialising or making new friends. but its damaging my mental health alot cos i end up spending like 90% of my time by myself either studying or recovering so i can get back to studying. when i get overwhelmed i just cry in my room until the stress of deadlines takes over and im forced to study again. my self-esteem is dying bcos im the common denominator and im convinced its my fault that ppl dont want to be arnd me. that i should be able to handle my course and STILL have the energy to socialise. ironically in order to get the support i need to overcome this, i need to learn how to be ok without it so that i become acceptable enough that ppl are willing to socialise with me without getting drained from me.

all the while my parents are telling me that oh back in their day they just thought abt making money and didnt care that they had no friends when in school, just focus on studying and u'll be happy.

i might just go full studying mode with zero socialisation until i get the degree, and im just wondering if anyone else is going thru this. if so, how are u able to cope with it? thanks.",78,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/17rmemo/socialising_in_uni_seems_impossible_for_me/,2023,11

Personally I'm one of them too and I'm not very bright either so it's hard to keep any new friends close. I'm also a depressing person to be around with when I'm feeling down so there's that. The close ones i still speak to often are okay with my silence and date further back.

But that doesn't mean you don't ease up and try to talk to people. Even if it's just small talk, i feel its ok. If it doesn't lead to close friendships, that's okay too. If you really gotta air something out you could vent somewhere online or speak to a counselor about more personal matters.

My advice is don't socialize with an expectation to make close friends. Just be kind wherever you can, someday I'm sure there'll be one or two close friends that will pop outta nowhere.",9,0,,2023,11

Btw if things get too rough don't hesitate to sign up for the University Counselling Centre. They might not be able to fully resolve your situation but it helps to have a listening ear.

&#x200B;

I have been in your shoes. I completely understand how you feel. I am also somewhat like you, in the sense that all I do is study + research....

Socializing is very important part of education. As with study, it requires practise.... I myself learnt a lot about socialising through books and online.... In fact, as many have pointed out, success is hardly what you know, but who you know.

With that in mind, I would ask you to reconsider your study method. If you are really taking 90 percent of your time just studying, that would highly suggest that you're probably doing it wrong (In My Opinion). Part of university is learning where and how to take shortcuts in learning.... learning how to cut corners and be strategic so that you can spend less time studying while maintaining a good GPA. 

I would also advise you to reconsider your relationship with your GPA... its hardly ever the be all end all of uni life. Spend time working on developing positive social skills by joining an interest group (CCAs what have you).

Also as I hear it, it can be difficult to make friends as a minority race, so if you are, consider joining one of those cultural CCAs.

big note: our urban society is a very abnormal environment, if u arent born with rich parents and need to hustle and work half your life, u dont have the resources to educate your children properly, that's why DINK phenomena is so prevalent, no offspring > problematic offspring.

My Y1 was fine, profs were understanding and kind, everything was basic and manageable. But ngl its still a bit of a jump from A Levels, I was told it's like A levels every semester. Everything just kinda snowballs after Y1 when the relaxed period is sorta over.

Readings are SO much ‚Äî and some have little to no short poems/proses, it's all LONG, LENGTHY texts ‚Äî I literally see my friends lugging physical hard copy versions (they're the size of BRICKS or bigger even).  And some texts can be AWFULLY DRY it's difficult to speed read and annotate.

And a question ‚Äî how do you guys actually prepare? 

Do you use audio books and read simultaneously? Do you annotate on the go immediately or reread after and do so? Do you make quotes bank or summarised essay plans? Say, out of 10 texts, how many do you actually read through with confidence? Do you (have the time and energy to) actually use LCC for help or what kind of help did you seek?

Speaking of help, seriously some Profs are such nuisance without any empathy. They gaslight you when you're sick with mc, saying they provided the module guideline since the start ‚Äî it's like I liased with the Holy beings to MAKE ME fall sick specifically during this period. They impose components like weekly journals such that on top of essays (think 3k words) you've to submit e.g. 10 journals each of 350 words AND class part that actually requires you to SPEAK UP (diff from class presentations component) aside from attendance. There's also the other blasphemous kinda profs that FORCES you to physically submit and collect back essays when you don't stay hall. Ngl, I miss those times when there's TA instead ‚Äî all the great profs have left due to Ntu's questionable administrative management. 

Altogether it makes studying English in ntu quite draining tbh. Speeding through different texts thats all touch and go in each seminar , expected to memorise chunks of all syllabus texts bc God forbid its open book , diff profs diff writing styles to cater to etc etc etc. The learning experience isn't fun at all and it's just testing ones rigour. I'm jaded at this point ‚Äî I'm mainly at the B range with a couple As, but I'm so jaded that I'm just done and unmotivated to pull myself together to seek that A. On top of that the modules I'm keen on are gone cus the profs have all left. It's just a cyclical Rinse repeat with different texts of different thematic concerns. 

I'm not cut out for sciences but ig I'm not cut out for humanities either. This uni experience sucks ‚Äî maybe I'm not cut out for it either. Just the beginning of the impending loooong rat race.  

And it feels like I'm the only one sunk to the bottom ‚Äî I see my peers all getting that bag. Those As. Sigh.",79,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/182080r/burnt_out_rant_from_a_burnt_out_humanities_kid/,2023,11

And you don't have to annotate from start to finish either. Just strategise ahead and pick the texts you know you'll use for your final exams/essays. Know those well, memorise a handful of quotes, and vaguely understand the rest of the syllabus. Read secondary sources to gather academics' opinions, it's easier to form your own argument this way while still taking into account the current opinion of the field (as compared to trying to come up with something from nothing). Also, most English profs to my knowledge are very willing to have consults, so go to them if you have any questions.

For the closed book exams, maybe you can try aiming for mods with research essays as the final submission or those with open book finals. I really didn't like the closed book exams either.

That said, a key part of the humanities is tweaking your style and approach for every class and professor simply because there is no one fixed answer - all of them come from different backgrounds with different experiences and are dealing with different fields so of course their expectations will differ. If you're not comfortable with that, then it might be a struggle for you overall. I hope it gets better for you though, jiayou!!

ETA: I didn't go to LCC, used audio books sometimes when I was too tired to read visually, had a quote bank with vague analysis for each quote (for some texts only), annotated only after reading secondary sources, and probably read like 6 out of 10 texts thoroughly and skimmed the rest.

i think part of your struggle comes from the a levels structure you are so used to (this is smth i heard alot from my jc friends too) bc in english, the structured/formulaic approach doesnt really work. if there‚Äôs one thing i learnt from my time there it‚Äôs study smart not hard. if you know the module has a final exam, look up past papers and roughly see how many diff texts you are required to know (add 2/3 more for essay on the off chance that you cant repeat texts) - this should be the number of texts you need to know well, the others i usually skim or look up summaries. i used to annotate alot but gave up after awhile bc it was just not practical.

regarding time management, what might help is taking a mix of CA mods and finals mods so your deadlines dont come all at once. i personally did better in mods with no finals so it took alot of planning to make sure i wasnt overwhelmed.

re: finals, you dont need a quote bank because you are not expected to memorise quotes! idk why this is not made explicit to students :‚Äô) the bar for finals is really low we are just looking for clarity and knowledge so you can describe a scene you want to use as an example without actually quoting from the text.

I didn't bother reading everything on the syllabus, because I'm not a speed reader and it's just too much. It was so stressful trying to finish a whole novel in like two weeks, multiply by three-four. I really tried, every night I forced myself to read for at least an hour, but I only read 50-60 pages an hour and that's horribly slow, considering we need to read like 200 pages. So I gave up, dropped two to three texts from every syllabus. I don't use audio books, they're distracting. I annotate as I go. I actively sought help from LCC, sometimes multiple sessions for one essay. I wasn't an FCH student, but with how stressful it was I wasn't aiming to be one either.

Sorry to hear that the nicer profs have left. I think each prof has their own way of doing things and sometimes we may not agree to it. You can definitely submit some teaching feedback at the end of the semester though. 

As for grades, I struggled with it a lot. And it sucks because you'll always have that one or two annoying competitive people going around asking people about their grades. Like c'mon this is not secondary school lol. Whenever I feel like I'm basing my worth on grades, I go back to this quote: ""I consider my best work to be my best grade, regardless of the letter. It's simple: if you work to the best of your ability, you've received the best grade you could have gotten."" Over the years I just stopped giving a damn about grades. If I got an A- and above, that's great. But a B+ ain't too bad either.

Somewhat not surprised to hear many have not completed their readings due to the volume of readings given. However, I guess I am those who were able to do so. Struggled at Y1 but after that, figured out the system and also who the lecturers were. So would emailed lecturers during term break for the required readings for the next term and completed going through them before term begins. Thus during the term, would have time to do secondary readings recommended by lecturers/tutors. Have to add that I did those not to stand out but merely cause I simply love to read. Didn't get many As though as I started EL late (spoke mostly mandarin when young) but enjoyed my Uni days. 

I guess OP has a better foundation in the course than me. Since you ruled out other courses (I'm not cut out for sciences but ig I'm not cut out for humanities either), why not just change your mindset and try to focus on doing your best to complete the course? Comparing with others will merely make you more depressed as there will always be someone better. Those As students, if they are also comparing with their peers, will bemoan not getting into the dean's list.

Basically read through the whole thing once carefully, memorize quotes that you like (won't be hard if you like it anyway), then skim through the book periodically to refresh your memory. Do some research with reference books on the book you're reading.

The latest cheat is to use ChatGPT to help you source out useful references online. The damn thing isn't perfect though. The more obscure the book, the less reliable the program becomes.

I didn‚Äôt understand this as an university student looking for an internship previously. But now that I‚Äôm on the other side of the table, I realise that if I have a highly desirable role on hand to offer, there‚Äôs going to be a few recommendations coming from people whom I work with or know that I trust, giving me recommendations on who would be a good fit for the job/internship and 90% of the time I‚Äôm going to lean on their recommendations vs taking on a cold candidate. The 10% of the time I take on a cold candidate is when the referral bombs the interview hard.

If you‚Äôre a cold candidate, use your time more effectively by hitting up people on LinkedIn in the roles that you want, try to build a connection with them and ask for the referral. It takes work and time to invest into getting the role, but it gives you a much better shot. 

Otherwise, a better alternative is to look for promising startups (companies like grab or Gojek aren‚Äôt considered start ups. These are more like adults that grew up but want to remain cool by pretending to be teenagers). When I say startups, I really mean small companies where they have less than 20 people. 

These startups tend to be underexposed and have very few quality candidates applying to work there. And the benefit is that you get to work directly with a founder who‚Äôs at least director, VP or MD level in a large company, learning directly from them. These guys usually have connections with larger companies too and if you do well, they could well become your advocate for landing the desirable internship/job that you want in the future.  

In a large company with desirable roles, these guys would be a few levels so far above you that you wouldn‚Äôt even get 5 mins with them. 

The work you do at a real startup is also scrappy and usually more impactful and you get to learn more. 

That said, be careful of some startups that shove menial and unmeaningful work at you. So when you‚Äôre interviewing for roles at these companies, pay attention to who the founder is, what you‚Äôre expected to do and whether you‚Äôre ready to be scrappy in a startup.",14,0,,2023,11

My dog is doing very poorly currently and will probably pass on within the next week. I am extremely devastated and consumed by grief and am all over the place.

Right now, I am doing round-the-clock care for him as the main caregiver. It's very emotionally and physically exhausting. It's akin to caring for a bedridden human, and the caregiver fatigue is setting in but I'm not complaining. My dog means the world to me and he is my family.

I know that my finals will definitely be affected. Is there a platform or portal that I can write to, to appeal for leniency?

I would also appreciate it if you could share your experience if you've been through something similar and tried to appeal. Do you know if it worked? What was the process like?

Thank you in advance.

Edit: My dog passed peacefully in his sleep earlier today. I emailed my school‚Äôs student care manager last night to request for special consideration and they replied first thing in the morning.

Prior to this I was working for 5 years in a totally different field from what I study now. When uni first started I wanted to give up too, I had to learn everything from scratch. But I didn't because I remember why I quit my job. The only advantage I have is the 5 year work experience which is irrelevant here. I know what you mean about the people around ya, ofc they are all smart to be able to enter ntu too, and yeah the exams hit me hard too.

But rather than comparing with them, try setting your own pace. I do this by learning purely the basics of what I study first. Instead of doing tutorials by tutorials, try doing in small bite size that's digestible. Its week 11 but it's never too late to build a strong foundation, then later you can start learning the more difficult parts. In summary, just master your basics and everything else will slowly fall into place.",11,0,,2023,11

I can give you some pointers on what I do for presentation, it's not the best but it's how I do it.

1) Don't think too much about it (USUALLY presentation don't have a heavy weightage, I focus on the other aspects, so presentation pass can le)

2) Breath (as dum as it sounds, you gotta calm yrself down and have enough breath to talk and not hyperventilate)

3) Put short pointers on your presentation, I would say like less than 7 words/sentence, but those pointers need to trigger your thoughts on what you want to share for that part. Put pictures if it helps you portray what you are presenting.

You could make a script, I don't do that, cos it makes me panic more and I realise I would start to rush through if i made a script fearing that I would forget what I want to share (with no cue cards)

I just group the main ideas I want to get across into small points, and elaborate a little more.

4) Eye contact: just find the most comfortable person you can find in class and stare into their soul jkjk, find that 1 person, maybe your closest fren in class and keep looking at them. OCCASIONALLY scanning your eyes around too.

It's fine to glance at your slides, but quick one to rmb your points will do. Don't look at the floor there's no money there üôÉ

1. audience members typically root for your success despite what your brain might be telling you, it takes a bit of practice as not to spiral and surrender to the debilitating fear.
2. audience members dont know the full scope of your content, speaking/presentation isnt a checklist you got to complete, focus on quality (meeting the presentation criteria/rubrics) instead of bombarding the audience with quantity. Feel free to skip slides if time is running out
3. im pretty visual person; i attach my talking point to certain images as a reminder of the talking points. i then add memorable image to each slide to help me recall them without looking like im simply reading off the slides
4. make use of 'Speaker Coach' feature on Ms. Powerpoint to get detailed feedback and have a bit of objectivity on what aspect of the presentation you can improve upon

it gets easier with practice, it's gonna suck for the first few times of presenting. The current pain hopefully won't matter in 10 weeks' time, 10 months' time or even 10 years' time.",8,0,,2023,11

Don't be afraid of emotions, more emotions = more engagement",8,0,,2023,11
1657,Comment,17qc14m,presentation anxiety for dummies,Heblehblehbleh,2023-11-08 04:08:13+00:00,"Just did mine yesterday, my group mates thought I did really well, I play alot of music and perform alot, or used to, I had a few rough presentations starting in NTU since I havent performed or presented in years before coming into NTU, but I kinda found my groove, what I do, which is what works for me is roughly have an idea for what I do, and then just practice it over and over again, I dont even say it out loud when im not alone. 

That's the thing, Im not a confident guy, im an introvert, I always second guess and regret things, but when its time to perform/present, all of it goes out the window and I focus on putting on a show for my audience, it is not a easy to acquire skill, it is a lifelong skill and I was very fortunate to have had an environment and life experience to hone this skill in the past.

The way I see/feel it is like turning on my shameless mode (like when you have these euphoric moments in public and do embarassing things for fun with friends like screaming at each other or smtg) but the energy is still contained to being however formal the presentation is.

Another trick is to use your slides as like a prompt. The way I do my slides are limited words if possible and more animated pictures (like those that appear on clicks) and/or use the slide title to memorise/prompt chunks of my imaginary script and also get into the headspace for that slide

Lastly is the slides themselves, you have to create them in a way that will allow you to naturally flow through it smoothly, this one I cant really give tips on, as it will be dependant on your style.

But all of these tips are very subjective, this is my unique way of presenting and your natural way may be a different one, the ultimate advice I can give is practice practice practice, use the practice to fine tune your your slides, your content in the first few runs, find any kinks in your presentation through practice and then see if you can change the slides to make it smoother or find a different to say it. And most importantly is to enjoy it, I get a sharp euphoria everytime I perform or nail a presentation, but still learn from the not so good ones. Once you get all these down, the presentation skills of pronunciation enunciation and where and what to emphasize on will come naturally.

Another big tip and a secret to how I got these skills are from music, maybe pick up a music instrument, not now though finals are near. Join your hall jamband or smtg, performing and learning to enjoy performing, showmanship skills (because Im a massive clown) etc, really gets me going during and after presentation, I still get quite nervous before presentations but I distract myself by doing practices in my head.

I see experienced musicians still being nervous of performing so it is not an unusual thing, so dont worry about it, I used to be like that also. How people adapt to it differs from person to person.

Sadly to say, none of these are silver bullet/overnight effect tips, but presenting is an accumulative skill, good luck for your presentation and even better luck for your future presentations mate

So my advice would be to type all your words into your slides and read off them. At least you will not have to think on your feet on what to say when your heart is racing at 200 beats per min. You might get fewer marks for presentation but you would still secure your content points. 

However, please try to work on your presentation skills after this. Not only will you have more presentations to do in future but probably at your future careers too. I joined the public speaking club in NTU and although I am still not an eloquent speaker, I am able to get my points across to my audience whenever I need to.

1. Write up a script of what you want to say, then try to based my presentation speech according to the script. What I typed in the script is not always what 100% of what I end up saying due to the difference in how you naturally speak and writing a script
2. Practice as much as I can to help myself understand what it kinda feels like during a presentation, it would be more helpful if you can also simulate the environment by being in an empty LT or room
3. If you have trouble doing eye contact, honestly you only need to make it so that you do so with the prof/lecturer that is marking you. You can avoid making direct eye contact with the class by just changing the direction which you are facing, 99% of the time the people watching your presentation cant tell if you are looking at them directly or just looking at the area right above their heads",1,0,,2023,11

In every other developed nation Engineering pays 6 figures. Hell, even in developing ones it is one of the highest paying sectors. Just because we can't value engineers in sg doesn't mean it is on the same level as the other majors. Like it or not it has a decent starting pay and the difference between engineering majors vs say business, whoever makes it in biz makes it big but most PPL struggle. Engineering has a high floor. 

I didn't know what i wanted to do in uni so I picked engineering because it is a safe bet. I am not particularly passionate about it but University education is an investment. I am happy to slog now in a subject I may not like so that I can stand a better chance at having a stable and decent livelihood than just waste 8k a year on an easier major just for the sake of having a degree.

 If you want to pursue a humanities major that's your business. Hell, if I could I would've picked History or something myself, but I don't come from a privileged background so I picked the majors which have the highest ROI. It is a fact that humanities majors have some of the poorest ROI of all majors. That isn't belittling, that is the truth. Also implying that my major requiring a deep understanding of advanced math and physics and extrapolating that to solve real world problems is somehow of equal difficulty to a humanities major having to write a bunch of papers a semester is just insulting. If it was that easy then anyone can become an Engineer. If you think it's that easy then you probably aren't in Science at all.

I'm not going to pretend that all majors are equal. Some are definitely more intensive than others, and it is a fact. Sorry not sorry, but like you said people value different things and I value getting some useful skills after 4 years in uni instead of just majoring in English just for the sake for getting a degree. 

Those who are truly ""passionate"" like you said will earn more than average, sure but what if that average is 3k? And they are capped at 5k? There are real, practical considerations you need to take while picking a major. Just anyhow pick then later can't find a job you can't blame anyone but yourself.

>When in fact, plently of people could have entered engineering based on their grades and atill got the degree and worked as an engineer either way.

They didn't do it, and that is poor judgment. Not something to brag about ah. You are entitled to your opinion, but the fact remains Engineering is one of the higher paying majors for a reason. You can enter engineering but finishing it is a different story all together. Why do you think so many people drop out?

>Besides many who entered engineering never really liked engineering, but went on to banking etc. they still got their degree though!! 

Which again proves the fact that I can quite literally do anything with my degree. Engineers are literally preferred more than Business majors in finance simply because the skills we learn are transferrable. 

>Why? Obviously the pay for engineers here is trash. Dont talk about 6 figures in other countries, youre here in sg, stay real

Which is still better than pay from other majors. Engineers make 6 figs STARTING in other developed nations. I'll be able to make that much in sg too, given time. Either way, the world is a small place and if I have to I don't mind going overseas for a better paying job.

I was previously was in HC and things are not as simple as it seems. 

If we break it down let's say your hall has 400 residents and each pay 10 dollars per semester for HC fees which gives us 4k and maybe let's say school matches the 4k. So now they have 8k for the events in the semester. Take away money for Hall olymipyad and various CCA costs such as instructors(3k roughly?) 5k is left for them to plan events. If your hall has maybe 10 events per semester(Inc EWI) that leaves them with 500 dollars per event. If budgeted so that some events are smaller then others they might be able to get 700 for EWI.

700 bucks is not a whole lot to work with, either there are more welfare packs that are lower quality, or lesser packs with higher quality. If we divide that down 120 packs you can only spend about 5 dollars each for each pack. So they have to find that sweet spot where they get the pack out to as many people as they can and where the pack has some actual value and the decision to lean on which side changes with the person planning it so things may vary.

Sponsors are a whole other can of worms, sponsors want to treat hall residents as commodities and the things they ask for can range from a survey to attending seminars. Personally I would feel like a terrible person if I was to sell out my residents to some FA sponsor for maybe like a few hundred bucks just so I can add another cup noodle.

Moreover, the most contested event of any hall and any faculty is EWI and everyone will be trying to get it. So sign ups will close pretty quick.

In conclusion, I think it's easy to chalk up these kinds of things to shady dealings and internal fixings especially with the things happening within the NTU student body these days, but these things are usually the exception not the rule. So maybe cut your HC some slack, no matter how incompetent they may seem, they are still trying their best.

You can try to attend more events and justify the payment for these fees if you are really fussed about the $10.80. It will definitely be worth it!

Regarding the cluster counterpart im assuming for it to be tamarind, they would definitely be able to cater to twice the amount due to them having twice the number of residents = twice the amount of funds.

1736,Comment,17r9dti,Hall Welfare Pack,VisibleChocolate8481,2023-11-09 14:15:17+00:00,"Firstly, to the previous comment, no. More often than not, council members don‚Äôt even get anything from exam welfare night or other events. Be it goodies, prizes, or even the food that is catered. Even if they do get a portion of food/bubble tea, there might not even be time for them to enjoy it because they‚Äôre so busy setting up, running the event, and tearing down afterwards. 

Additionally, to OP, have you tried sourcing for sponsors yourself? Nothing in this world is free. Sponsors often require something in return and their items are not always as universal than something the HC decides to buy after deliberation (save for snacks, but there‚Äôs always the issue of it being halal or not as well.) Perhaps next time, before you speak about such things or run your mouth accusing people of not doing their jobs ‚Äúwell enough‚Äù , you could have some empathy for the people who are doing more than what you (a normal resident, as you mentioned in another comment) are doing. They are students as well but they‚Äôre doing their best. 

And do you really genuinely think $10.80/semester entitles you to an exam welfare pack, along with whatever other welfare they have provided in their other events? It‚Äôs $10.80 in this economy, it‚Äôs barely enough to get a meal + drink at the canteen. Please refrain from making yourself sound so entitled and self-absorbed and have some heart & empathy for people who are doing things for the residents outside of the same 24hours that you have, instead of merely sitting behind a screen to complain.",83,0,,2023,11

Cost price of the most basic tote bag is 1-2 bucks. Ppl of course sell to you for a profit, 3-4 bucks. You add in printing cost, and it's at minimum 5-7 bucks already. 

And that's for the most basic tote bags and design. You want higher quality, designer help u do the design, easily ten bucks per piece liao. 

You can check on shopee or Lazada, the most basic custom tote bags are already between 5-8 bucks. Now I don't know how ntu SU buys stuff but pretty sure they can't just go shopee buy right. Really fancy custom tote bags can go up to 20 or 30 bucks. Reasonably, you buy a basic design or tote bag can be cheap if you buy ALOT. 

So let's say you are buying at ten bucks per piece, you buy 700 pieces for an event, 7k seems plausible.
Or maybe for open house they expect 3000 people, so they do more basic one at 2.50 per piece with bulk order. In this case also plausible.

Went to try and get my graphic calculator sealed today but the lady refuses to seal it because the model name is not on the front (screen) but at the back? It's an approved model according to NTU website, but her reason was that there are alot of students in the exam hall and the invigilators can't quickly see the model since it's not at the front. She insist on it and I had no choice but to leave the office defeated and go for my exam this evening. Is this justified, because I think it's bullcrap!

Granted, there seem to have been a model name at the front also, but due to wear and tear from my sibling's time at JC, it had rubbed off. Even the white plastic has browned out. But this is unreasonable. Graphic calculator are expensive, she expect me to fork out $100 just for a model name at the front when there is one at the back?

235,Post,18v9dgj,Hall (W)hammy,jjajjangmian,2023-12-31 14:56:44+00:00,"Since my freshie days, I have always thought Hall W (time for you to start guessing which hall is hall W) was one of the best halls to stay in (personal pov, don't flame me just yet). Blessed with good connectivity to food options and good room size and modern toilets. I was so determined to move to Hall W when I was in Year 2. However, Hall W's management has fallen drastically over the years (and never managed to recover even till now). Let's elaborate on this...

===========

During this IHG/IHRG season (aka last few months), I heard from my hall friends that Hall W was not participating in many games. This left me very befuddled as I always knew Hall W to be a hall which excelled in at least one sports or rec games. More probing revealed that the hall council did not manage to source umpires and/or players in time for the IHG/IHRG season which has left to either handicap or ineligibility to participate in games.

The rec secs mentioned to their rec captains that they weren't aware of the need for table umpires until one week before the actual games. This was despite attending regular meetings throughout the semester with the other rec secs, having constant discussion on the flow of the inter-hall games, and even being the convenors of one of the rec games. 

But, there were always solutions to this: 
- Ask hall council to fill the spots as table umps (since they are all in this tgt as one whole council)
- Ask subcomm to fill in the slots and help each other out (afterall they are getting points for it)

Instead, these 2 options were claimed to be not possible because it was said that ""it would be too late to ask anyone to help given such short's notice"".

===========

For context, Hall W had implemented some new positions this year that got me (and my friends) super confused at the need for it.

1. They had increased their rec secs frm one to two. This meant the workload could be shared between two people (or so you thought...)
2. They created new rec subcomm positions (apart from the captains). Honestly, I only hear their work being to enforce ""attendance-taking"" for rec games and that's about it (they don't even participate in the rec game that they are attached to btw lmao)

All these measures did not help but even exacerbated the entire situation. One of the rec secs had booked a trip during the December holidays and claimed that it was booked before he/she was even elected into the hall council. So this left us wondering that this rec sec took the position up, get hall pts and then just passes all work to the other rec sec (IHRG supposed to be their main job for the whole year btw).

But before you pity the other rec sec, the other rec sec also had his/her own commitments during IHRG and so he/she wasn't even available to ump for some days in IHRG. This was why some rec games couldn't proceed because Hall W's players boycotted as they did not want to be disadvantaged and penalized for not having enough table umps. Mind you that these rec games had enough players to be fielded as a team.

The two rec secs (and hall council) couldn't enforce the subcomm (in pt 2) to empty their time out during the holidays to help just to table umpire due to them not having given enough notice (and also they themselves not being available). In the end, I heard they couldn't even provide enough table umps for the few rec games that they were participating in. Thankfully, the players weren't penalized on it and still went on to achieve some results despite the setbacks.

===========

Let alone the rec games, apparently the hall couldn't field enough players for soccer (which was one of, if not, the hall's strongest sports two years back). So what is the hall council actually doing? AITA for being so triggered? ü§î

P.S: had to post this on NYE because saw them posting their hall council photos and was reminded of this. nevertheless, happy new years to everyone :)",61,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/18v9dgj/hall_whammy/,2023,12

Sports are non-existent other than ulti and bball, some sport captains are captains in name only! Overall no one is motivated to train for sports other than ulti we have a good chance this year. The rec games' presence and participation are stronger than the sports but most of them didn't get to play as said by OP, but darts got 4th so kudos to them.  
The hall has its fair share of irresponsible masterchefs who are allergic to cleaning up after themselves and are looking to build an ant nest in the pantry. The toilets are modern with people loving to leave the drains clogged up (1-day trip to the Amazon Rainforest) and their turds unflushed with explosive diarrhea greeting you in the morning. If you are not in either the blue or yellow clan, sorry to say your clans will be non-existent.  
Ofc how can we not forget about the JCRC, half of the top 5 were boycotted during the election phase but due to a lack of candidates they were eventually elected to be in the top 5 again. From the rumours going around, the JCRC is pretty toxic but its rumours so take it with a pinch of salt. That being said they seem to be nice people.  
H11 has 4 blocks 53-56, 53 is the ghetto right beside the construction site with dust and noise being your best friends. In thunderstorms, 53 may get blackouts LOL. 55 is closest to the red bus stop. 54 closer to Tama. 56 similar to 55. H11 gets first blue and first red in the morning.  
Food options are plenty with Can11, Tama, and HHO nearby. Can11 Cai Fan isn't cheap anymore > cheapest prob Crespion currently, Tama China Cai Fan is a trap. Can11 milo peng shouldn't exist coffee and teh is decent, tama milo peng varies sometimes have weird chemical taste.  
So for those looking for a place to stay and exist only h11 is pretty good, points might be a problem if you are looking to continue staying for years since most of the sports don't get further than the group stage and the only way would be to join the JCRC which may not be such a good idea.",24,0,,2024,1

What do ladies look for in a guy when they approach them?  Whenever I think of approaching someone I get doubts as to what the other person would think or what would happen after that. Really need some advice on this to overcome the fear of approaching,57,69,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/18py8b6/how_to_rizz/,2023,12
245,Comment,18py8b6,How to rizz,Zealousideal-Week515,2023-12-24 17:28:14+00:00,"Feel free to take my advice with a pinch of salt.

I think what most girls look for in a guy is someone who is comfortable in their own skin, of course not in an obnoxious kind of way. 
Treat her like how you would want someone else to treat your sister/ female friend you care about.

Boundaries are important too my guy. Respect that and girls will feel safe around you. Even if it means being seen as a lame person or a simp by other people. 

And there‚Äôs also much value in being forthcoming about your intentions. I‚Äôm sure women appreciate that once done well. 

Other than that take care of yourself and your family too. A lot of the so called rizz in my personal opinion isn‚Äôt oozing simply from one‚Äôs own pores but it‚Äôs greatly reflected in how they treat the people in their lives.

Also it be good to do some self searching, so you know thyself and your shortcomings so they don‚Äôt catch you off guard.
Especially your own value system so you don‚Äôt make regretful mistakes in a split second of misjudgement that you‚Äôve to bear with the rest of your life

It‚Äôs oke to not be perfect. The right one for you will stay eventually.

Edit: why pinch of salt? I‚Äôm a pretty traditional oddball so to me these are green flags that will definitely attract me to someone regardless of their social status, career prospects or net worth etc etc things our generation seem to keep a hawk eye on.",98,0,,2023,12

250,Comment,18py8b6,How to rizz,depetir,2023-12-25 14:36:41+00:00,"Many people mentioned being respectful and treating her normally, which is true, but also be honest with your intentions. It's disappointing if you become friends and they find out you have ""ulterior motives"" after they thought they made a good friend. Do NOT treat their friendship like a consolation prize! Also yes act like yourself but be the best version of yourself you can be. Don't put on a front or be fake or act like an a-hole. 

Another important thing is shower frequently and use deodorant (feels like this goes without saying but SO many dudes in school walk by and give off strong odours). No one will care if you are slightly less attractive than average but it will be absolutely unbearable to be in the presence of someone with a bit too much B.O. 

Wear something you are comfortable but not too lupsup in, dress slightly more than the bare minimum. Optional but I think this helps a lot in elevating your look. People underestimate how a good personality, well fitting clothes and confidence is. 

Lastly, I think too many people make ""getting a girlfriend"" their biggest goal in life when it shouldn't be. People like this are visibly desperate and no one wants to be with someone who will take anyone, anyone that even remotely likes them. Which girl will want to be replaceable? Before getting a girl it's good to make sure you enjoy your own company and are happy by yourself. Take good care of yourself because you deserve it (like cleaning and putting on skincare because you deserve good skin that you feel comfortable in, eat (or maybe also cook) good and balanced meals because you deserve to be nourished, etc). If everything else in your life feels whole and complete, you will naturally be more confident and easier to talk to.",9,0,,2023,12

More than just being engrossed in conversations, pay attention to the details like remembering the other person‚Äôs favourite thing to do and casually mentioning it the next time.

Humour. I feel like this point may sometimes not be expressed correctly. What I mean is most people just throw it out there that guys should have some humour in him that creates laughter or spontaneously find humour in daily conversations. Sure, if it comes naturally, that‚Äôs great. However, being natural or just staying true to yourself is probably the best. Don‚Äôt force anything that is too out of character because it may come off as awkward or cringey at worst. Sure, go ahead and watch some comedy shows or videos and pick up a thing or two. You could probably throw them in between conversations as awkward fillers or in suitable contexts which will definitely be refreshing. However, sometimes your own humour could just be something as simple as not knowing how to respond to certain situations, which may even come off as cute. The point is, you never really know which girl out there finds your actions humorous and endearing. 
I would say just be yourself (comfortably so) and be spontaneous.",1,0,,2023,12

I've had so many nasty interactions with people since I started uni that have legitimately left me confused. I genuinely do not understand how most people's default response is to be an absolute A\*\* hole.

Text someone new? They don't respond or at best take a couple of days/weeks to get back to you.

Person you're acquainted or friends with sees you? Doesn't greet you nor respond to your greeting.

Meet a person you get along REALLY well with online? Turns out they never learned to use their vocal chords. Oh and God forbid you ask them to do something unthinkable like get lunch with you or hang out after class nooooo. Apparently that's the equivalent of releasing mustard gas on all their blood relations.

Ask someone in your group to do work? They either half a\*\* it or do nothing.

Ask someone to keep their commitments? Oops guess they had to go to the zoo or something and now you're a man down for your project

Petty argument or mild discomfort? Ghost or block.

I used to think I just had the luck of a guy that got hit by lightning 7 times in a span of 10 minutes, but turns out a lot of my friends have run into such unsavoury characters themselves with makes me ask: WHAT IS UP WITH PEOPLE?

Has covid really f\*\*ked us up so much? Has an over dependence on texting ruined everyone's social skills? Seriously, I cannot tell you how many people I've run into who I've texted for hours and hours, but if they see me in person they can't muster up the courage to say ""hi"".

No one seems to care about their interpersonal relationships with other people. They literally just be a d\*uche and don't care about the consequence. Since when has the default response to meeting a new person been being mean to them? Not responding to their texts? Not finishing your part of the work? Not delivering on your promises?

Do people not care that other people think they are grade A d\*uchebags anymore? Or is this how things have always been and I've just been brought up differently? I swear, if my mama caught me acting like some of y'all she'd whoop my a\*\* in public.

For the life of me I can't understand how being polite to someone you just met is NOT the default response

I can't understand how people you know and who see you don't greet you or respond to your greeting

I can't understand how people take 2 weeks to get back to you when you need help or just leave you on read but then shamelessly text you when they need something

I can't understand how a person can make commitments then back off last minute with some bs excuse like ""sorry my friends asked me if I want to go join them for a bbq so I cant help you guys with the project""

Someone please help me understand this. I don't even know if this is like culture shock or something or if high iq translates to low eq, but regardless I am so done with people. I am so so so done.

Their behaviour is something you can't control, and there will always be people who grow distant or get toxic when you don't act the way they expect you to. Also, I find that some of them were just ...not taught by anyone about politeness/manners.

Unfortunately I'm going to have to side with the people that says maybe you have some self reflection to do. My take is if it happens to you too often then you might have some tone deaf issues when it comes to reading the mood / atmosphere, so gotta take it in stride as self criticism, and work on yourself much more.

From what I can read in your post, it seems that you feel you are automatically entitled to other people's time and energy, and that is not the correct way to interact with other people. If I had to make a guess, other people can probably smell that attitude oozing off of you and they probably take every effort to purposely avoid you. 

I'll tell you one thing for sure too, continue holding the view that everyone else is wrong or against you. Nothing will change for you, your situation will probably carry on as it is, maybe even later on in working life.",32,0,,2024,1

I think in general if youre nice enough to people, there‚Äôs no reason for other people to not be nice to you back. I dont think its normal for acquaintances/friends to not acknowledge you if they see you. They might not say ‚Äúhi‚Äù vocally esp if youre some distance away but theyll def wave or nod or smtg. But, i dont think its abnormal for people youve never met irl to be cautious/awk about meeting irl, even if youre rly close online. Ive had a close online friend for more than a decade but i would feel so awkward if we were to ever meet irl so im glad it hasnt happened so far üòÖ i am also naturally more comfortable with texting than talking f2f, so im generally quiet irl. Don‚Äôt feel offended if any of your friends seem to be the same. 

I think you might have to rethink some of your approaches. If so many things aren‚Äôt working out for you, im so sorry i hate to sound harsh but maybe you are the reason üò£ but i think it is a good time to reflect. Better now than in the corporate world where relationships are even more impersonal

Are you perhaps a little too enthusiastic/passionate/extroverted/ caring about things? Many people can find it overbearing and end up ignoring you. Are your expectations perhaps too different? Singaporeans are not the most amiable people and we don‚Äôt really greet each other the way Americans/Australians do, so it may end up seeming rude. We usually just greet each other with a short hi, or even just a silent wave/nod/smile; and nothing afterwards if youre mere acquaintances. There‚Äôs also a need to find a balance between giving your group members their freedom and ensuring they commit to the work, and often this boils down to communication. I found that the most efficient way to get work done is to get the ball rolling yourself by allocating roles early, making everyone is on the same page about the flow/content/etc. and setting a deadline maybe abt 3-5 days before the actual submission while giving everyone at least 2-3 weeks to get their work done at their own pace. Just check in on them every week for their progress and make sure you finish your own work faster :) people will often be pressured a little when they see that others have alr done the work

We tend to forget that we are ""Social-Beings"" and not ""Social-media Beings"". The fact that most people prefer texts over calls or in person meetup because of the inconvenience (described by most as ""just being lazy""). This all also contributes to being self-centered. It is good to grow initially, but flawed for overall and ultimate growth, and people don't get it. 

I recommend, be more inviting and spontaneous. In a place like Singapore, where the law is super strict, and has high public trust, you should not be afraid to approach others and should also not be afraid if someone approaches you. Be more open minded and considerate.

Agree and feels that my feelings are validated. However, I am aware of this issue with myself as well. 

There are 3 types of people in uni

1. Those who are academically inclined, obviously will enjoy their uni life
2. Those who don't give a damn about their grades, still might enjoy their uni life
3. Those struggling in uni, will constantly fret over their studies. 

I assume the majority belongs to #3, I belong to there as well. I consciously try to smile during interactions but my inner self is too stressed over my studies that I can't bring myself to. 

Having too much over your plate, even trying to produce a ""simple"" gesture feels like a very troublesome and tiring thing to do. You know that feeling when you are being rushed for a deadline.

Moreover, this increasing trend in lack of social engagement is not the fault of students; our generation has faced major setbacks due to the pandemic, disproportionally affecting those with pre-existing anxiety by exacerbating their existing condition. Additionally, social media has tragically promoted para-social relationships that have, for a long time now, deluded us into unwittingly thinking they're genuine connections. As a result, our social skills have noticeably declined due to a severe lack of social interactions with others. Although these social challenges weren‚Äôt our fault, I do agree that it's our responsibility to address them. Individuals like you are doing their part by initiating conversations and inviting discussion, so it's fair to hold others accountable for not contributing similarly.

People started warming up more, when I was in advanced classes geared towards students going into research/academia (because everyone had that shared passion, so we would stay up after class chatting for hours about the class material), or when I was in ‚Äúfor fun‚Äù classes like philosophy or literature.

It just meant I feel disappointed with my experience for the effort I put in. You as a local student are also welcome to feel that way, irrespective of whether you worked hard to get in or not.

Not all interactions though. You may meet a few genuine and remain friends for life. But most of the times after the project/semester ends, you don't even talk. People only want to interact for the sake of ""networking"". Nobody wants to connect. People only want to know you if you have something to offer that they can stand to gain. Module notes, past projects, connections (exco, parents, money), internship/job opportunities or even... sex.

just play along with it, no need to get upset. Control what you can control, don't bother controlling what you can't control. If a person doesn't acknowledge your presence, then, just never say hi to him/her again. Get used to it bah, the working world is even scarier how fake people can be. One day they are like good friends - ""work besties"", always agreeing with what the other person says. One fine day, one simple misunderstanding/argument and they never ever talk to each other anymore and tries the darnest to get other fired or until one or the other quits.

I don't think you're wrong about certain people being assholes. I've met many people in school who only cared about grades and would be fake to you just to get benefits. On the other aspects however:  


>No I would not. I am just normal. I'm not too outspoken but I'm not so introverted either.

From your post and comments, I would consider you extroverted though. I have many introverted friends and they don‚Äôt want to talk to people even when in group settings, and/or need a day at home after just going out for a few hours to socialise. Many introverts also dislike small talk because it takes a lot of energy from them.

While it might seem like a ""lack of effort"" or ""rude"" from your perspective, it's actually a characteristic of introversion (or they could even just simply be shy). They are perfectly normal, nice and good hearted people otherwise. As another commenter pointed out in a separate comment thread, understanding the perspective of others is part of tact and social eq. This could be one of the reasons why people are saying that you come off as entitled in this post, because you expect them to be what you personally consider ""normal"".  


>Then it really is cultural because where I'm from it is rude to do so

In context of texting, I think the issue with being so connected through our phones is that it has made us forget that you are not entitled to someone‚Äôs time, regardless of whether they are busy or not. Sure, you HAVE the time and energy now to do your homework - but you just don‚Äôt want to do so. Why does that suddenly not apply in texting? I‚Äôm not talking about urgent questions/emergencies, if they don‚Äôt reply you then yes, that is their problem, but if you‚Äôre simply saying stuff like ‚Äúhey wassup‚Äù why is it wrong for the other person to simply not want to reply right at the moment? A lot of people disagree with this concept but I feel that it worth explaining regardless.

Btw just for context, I'm an extrovert!",1,0,,2024,1

I'm living proof that it doesnt mean jackshit so dont stress it and do something u love! Unless that, u really do love ur gpa then u can keep comparing it with others'.

>¬†And our govt is stupid enough to give free ride scholarship to them.

I can make out that you're extremely ignorant just based on that statement. The Singaporean Government doesn't offer any scholarships without a bond for non-locals. Those full ride scholarships you're talking about come with a 6 year bond. The tuition grant comes with a 3 year bond.

Second, not everyone gets into NTU and even fewer are offered any scholarship and even fewer are offered a full ride. I can guarantee you that if tomorrow all the scholarships meant for international students were given to locals instead a person of your calibre would still not qualify for them. The really talented Singaporeans have no trouble getting financial support. Just open the financial assistance page and pretty much everything is only for SG PRs/Citizens, a stark difference from universities in Australia, UK, US, and Canada. 

Frankly I find this attitude really disgusting. Singapore was built by immigrants and your grandparent or great grandparent was one of those immigrants too.

Your English definitely needs work. I don't understand what you're trying to say. If you mean to say the foreigners you're getting in NTU are undeserving, I'm sure both you and I know that's untrue. 

It isn't a secret that the admission criteria for foreigners is much higher than local students. You don't understand how hard it is for us to get a job or an EP even and how hard we must have to work for it.

It's a fact that all government sponsored scholarships come with a bond. You are welcome to prove me wrong with sources. I'd be happy to know of any.

People like you just can't make up their minds. One day it's ""all these damn immigrants coming over here and taking my job. Why don't they go back to their own country?"" and the next day is ""All these damn immigrants not staying back and taking jobs and leaving for other countries. Why don't they show some gratitude?"". 

Face it, if you think -3 downvotes means anything on reddit you really are an enormous loser fr. It's an unpopular opinion because no one likes to hear the truth, but the truth don't lie. Only people I hear complaining about immigrants taking their jobs or opportunities are bums like you. My very talented Singaporean friends seem to think it's a net benefit to this country. Maybe it's just your skill issue y'know. Tomorrow if you send all the foreigners home you're still not going to get whatever high paying PMET job simply because you don't deserve it. It'll be taken up by a Singaporean who is more capable. Then what are you gonna do? Start blaming New Citizens? LOL

This is the original comment, which, if you can't understand, erroneously talks about international students, specifically from China, using Singapore as a springboard to other nations despite the government apparently offering all of them full rides.

This is blatantly false, for the reasons I have outlined in my comment. At the very least the ones receiving any sort of financial assistance from the government are on a bond, which implies that they are here for a certain minimum number of years so no they are not just taking subsidy without giving anything back, should they deserve to leave

So this:

>and the bond means there's less jobs for locals

I had near perfect scores to get into NTU. This country is a meritocracy and all your comment tells me is you're butthurt some guy from a country whose name you can't pronounce is much more capable than you. 

That's the difference you see: you can't control the circumstances of your birth but you can control where you end up. You were lucky enough to be born as a Singaporean, but what have you done with that privilege? There's no substitute for merit 

And like it or not Singapore was built by immigrants. The majority ethnic group in this country are descendants of immigrants, and Singapore flourished, and continues to flourish, because of immigrants. 

>and maybe one day you'll learn that if everybody dislikes you, then you're probably the problem

tldr: in a 2year situationship, finding ways to get him to confess and take it seriously

I've been in a situationship with a guy for over 2 years now, but he hasn't officially labeled us as a couple. we do all couple things when we meet, such as tying my hair, spending NYEs picnic together, star gazing, and frequent weekend meetups. we have both graduated from NTU btw! Despite this, he introduces me as just a friend, to his friends and even his grandma.  
As someone with anxious attachment, he regularly updates me about his day, transparent about his activities and informs me where he is (so he probably isn't cheating) . plus, he doesn't get guarded about his phone or social media. he probably also isn't categorizing our friendship as purely sexual or FWB, as he has never initiated any sexual advances or nor of anything in a sexual nature.

I feel he is the one for me, and from time to time subtly hinted and discuss the idea of an official relationship. however he usually brushes it off or dodges the subject completely. This worries me as i'm unsure of his reasoning behind his actions and his hesitation, whether he is taking all the time we spent together the past years seriously.  
There are thoughts that crossed my mind, such as him feeling too safe getting too comfortable in our situationship, thus taking what we have for granted. im leaning to advice i heard from close friends, such as making him jealous intentionally so he can realise and hopefully spur himself to take action. (i understand its toxic, but i rather do all i can before considering the possibility of ending the situationship)  
Thus, what are some ways or possible least toxic strategies to get him to confess and take our 2 year situationship seriously/officially?",123,97,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/19bavc1/in_a_2_years_situationship_how_to_make_him/,2024,1

We have been seeing each other for >2 years now, and I see ourselves together in an official relationship.

And I hope that we can be official. I need to know if you're committed to this relationship because your actions and hesitations signal some confusion to me.

Let me know what you think of us""

I advise against the jealousy game. Doesn't do anyone any good. You're both adults, and playing games is extremely tiring and uncalled for

Stand up for yourself, and be firm. Personality gets you through the door, but character is what makes one stay. If this mismatch in expectations and character isn't what you want, then leave

I'm confident that both of you can talk things out - things that 2 mature adults are capable of

Flip side: he could be just holding on to you because you meet some (not all) of his criteria. Maybe he's having second thoughts? 

This is how you're feeling right now. So instead of guessing what he's thinking, ask him directly. Communication is important.",15,0,,2024,1

So you are basically NOT in any relationship right now.

You could be in one if you are both comfortable with each other and attracted to each other. It seems the problem is, this chap may not see you that way.

I‚Äôd suggest you move this up or out. Let your friend know that you want to be more than friends and see if he feels that way as well. If he does not‚Ä¶ you may lose this friendship, but frankly you need to get your life back and start finding someone else, if you want a romantic relationship. 

Trust me, potential male interests will avoid you with this chap hanging around. And you won‚Äôt be looking for them either as long as you are thinking about this.

It‚Äôs up or out; don‚Äôt waste your youth on something that is stuck in limbo like this.  To the extent that he‚Äôs also stuck like this, it‚Äôs also good for him to go up or out.

This worries me as i'm unsure of his reasoning behind his actions and his hesitation, whether he is taking all the time we spent together the past years seriously. 

I think this is very important. 

Why not try to find out the reason to his hesitance? - Not ""hinting"" him or bring up the topic of the relationship. But rather ask him directly, and tell him that you want a serious, direct, no-nonsense answer and give him time to process and answer. Further reading: [https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/i-message](https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/psychpedia/i-message)

If you are his first, there's a high chance that he just don't know how to ask or what to do. So he hides his self-perceived incompetence by avoiding the topic altogether. 

Also, your ""friends"" are pretty toxic to give you that kind of off-the-cuff advice to a very serious and impactful situation. It always goes both ways, if you were to make him jealous, he might then make you jealous. Then how? What is your expected outcome from making him jealous? Remember to see it from his perspective. What if he was the one to make you jealous. This ""jealous"" thing doesn't work, good on you to recognize that! 

I read a quote once, and lived by it since, kinda forgot who said this but it goes something like this:

How does that work out, does that mean I be using Year 4 to clear my AUs, but be disqualified to write my thesis for my honours since in no shape or form is my GPA going to become 4 plus overnight..

Job prospect wise I regret choosing what the working world sees as a useless degree aka English.

Honestly I don‚Äôt even know how I‚Äôm going to get a good enough job to pay off the debts I‚Äôve buried myself in aka student loan as well as support my parents since I am the oldest child.

Not able to advise on the thesis part but google search led me [here](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.ntu.edu.sg/docs/librariesprovider120/english/english-current-course-offering-achives/ay2020-2021/semester-2-ay2020-2021/fyp-information--latest-june-2020.pdf%3Fsfvrsn%3D9992d09a_2&ved=2ahUKEwi3np7AvcGDAxWfbWwGHToXCAIQFnoECBgQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3ptWBgCOLQOwdynxLeWD2I)  

Lastly, I hope you manage to cheer up and pick yourself up. A fact that might help cheer you up is that only a small percentage of people end up doing whatever they majored in college. And tbh, I think the prospects available to English majors are quite broad.

For your last 3 sems, I would recommend aggressively learning about your possible prospects and narrowing a specialty that you do not mind working in for the long term. I think some interesting jobs might be: HR (good money if u can stick to it), marketing copywriter, PR, social work, etc.

Thereafter, I think you should try to secure an internship in the summer. And if you can cope, a part time intern during sem as well. If you can't win them with your GPA, win them with real world experience. 

I personally think, your life isn't just defined by your career! if you really can't find a job you love, you can always do english tutoring to expats and earn loads of money to fund your hobbies/lifestyle. if you like kids then be a school teacher (job security is a huge plus).

Ten years ago, I left NUS with a computer engineering degree in hand and a 2.92 GPA. My journey wasn't conventional. After a rough two years filled with C's and D's even though I worked my ass off because the the course was so freaking difficult for me, I was riddled with anxiety about my grades and future. But then, a realisation struck after some reflections. Instead of chasing grades, I decided to prioritise taking  courses that I will enjoy rather than for grades.  This shift in mindset transformed my university experience and helped my anxieties to fade. The remaining time at NUS became a period of discovery.

After graduation, the surprise hit me: **no one, not a single interviewer, even mentioned anything about GPA.**  The NUS and NTU branding  coupled with high demand for tech professionals was strong enough to open doors for me.

595,Post,19f2ufk,Horrendous campus bus frequency,RisenPhantom,2024-01-25 06:20:38+00:00,Why does it seem like the bus frequency has significantly dropped since last year? It used to be that I'd get a bus every 5-6 minutes; since this sem started I've been waiting for upwards of 10-15 mins. There's only 2 buses each side in the ENTIRE loop. I've been late for multiple lessons even if I made it a point to leave hall earlier.

I distinctly recall that the government was saying they needed more aviation related people to help cope with the surge of travellers.
Source:  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/aviation-sector-jobs-opening-2024-chee-hong-tat-changi-airport-caas-employment-3677721?cid=internal_sharetool_androidphone_07012024_cna

Also in a side note, I thought this reasoning applies to accountancy and business courses (which is another course whose IGP dropped rather significantly) as the government recently declared a huge shortage of accounting professionals and they want to encourage more students to take the degree
Source: https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/singapore/task-force-set-persuade-more-take-accountancy-and-change-boring-tag

So in conclusion, I don't think the IGP dropped because these courses are 'irrelevant' and 'useless' but are in fact the opposite. They're so relevant and useful such that they're now willing to lower the bar so that they at least have sufficient pipeline of students to produce more of these 'professionals'",4,0,,2024,1

What many JC top scorers forget is A Levels scores that they did well is just because they are an all-rounded. They didn't realise that at uni level, it is not like u can definitely do well just by mugging hard. To really be the best in a field, one really needs to have that passion/interest (the fire in them) and also certain level of aptitude (to have that innate intuition). So these top scorers thought that they can do the same just mug and still get top pay for courses that they have zero interest in. But more often than not, they wouldn't become the best due to lack of interest or aptitude, and will stuck at average or below average worker in the popular field, and worst with no career satisfaction in the first place. What they forget is that what matters more is how proficient can they be in the field they choose that gives them the long-term career progression where real success and top money/salary comes, rather than them currently over-obsessed with starting pay from the GES.",1,0,,2024,5

Yes I agree COL is very high in sg, and current housing HDB for youngsters now is really unaffordable (We seriously cannot be letting our HDB flats appreciate in value forever, its not gonna be sustainable, and youngsters will suffer eventually). But I feel apart from housing, it seems that youngsters now are not being realistic in terms of balancing their wants and needs, and reconciling with the reality of society. I think it is contributed by the generational shift that is currently occurring now, where more and more new parents in sg are much more affluent than in the past, so they are providing much more material comfort to the younger generation (including many more kids nowadays travel overseas even before like 12 or 16 years old). So these kids end up grew up to cannot live without these material comforts, thus becoming more materialistic and just go for degree courses that generally pays better, regardless if they have interest or strengths/aptitude or not. This societal trend in SG is actually very concerning, as future generations of sg will start to lose themselves and just live and work to live up to their own materialistic wants, with no passion in anything in life.",1,0,,2024,5

There was already a petition 2 years ago to abolish grading ICC (or at least let people S/U them, they are literally gonna using their S/U quota on this) but it obviously did not work.

Firstly that the university should be able to mandate what skills we must acquire, and secondly that CC mods are remotely effective in achieving any of the outcomes that they claim they do. It's literally university education, we don't need an angry asian parent holding our hands telling us what we do or do not need to know to be certified as a human being. Not to mention that students whose disciplines exactly coincide with CC modules are still not exempt from learning repeated and often dumbed down curriculum (think sports science needing to learn about healthy living, or computer science students needing to learn about the digital world). CC modules are a pitiful attempt to provide holistic learning, and those who defend it on the basis of grades lose sight of the actual purpose of their tertiary education.",5,0,,2024,1

801,Comment,18xblpy,what to do about icc mods destroying my grades,internet-sloth,2024-01-04 15:06:08+00:00,"i'm realising that my comment makes me sound like such a d*ckrider of icc mods üíÄ so let me preface this by clarifying that i'd be happy too not having to deal with the extra workload of icc... but at the same time i don't hate it? i may complain about them from time to time, but i guess i still see some value in it.

your criticisms are valid, though i personally wouldn't go as far as to say that there is too much hand-holding in the curriculum. (i will acknowledge that my personal bias could be at play here since my prior education felt way more rigid than ntu's curriculum and maybe i'm not familiar enough with what a holistic education should look like.) probably an unpopular opinion, but i think icc mods for the most part do an okay job at balancing structure and creative freedom. i also like some form of structure since there's just so much information out there in the world that narrowing it down makes things less overwhelming. i get how this could be seen as the school desperately trying to shove things down our throats and may feel suffocating for some people though. i'm kind of curious about your thoughts on what a better approach would be, if the university should interfere at all.

in regards to your point about the overlapping content, i agree that it ruins the experience a little. maybe some find it to be not intellectually stimulating enough. for me i still found some value in these mods even if my discipline has already covered much more in depth knowledge about the topic of discussion. as a computer science student, i may learn about how programming and algorithms work in my course, but i don't think i had given enough thought about the many creative ways technologies emerging from my field can be harnessed or the ethical considerations involved. i also appreciated the challenge of explaining some computer science concepts to other students who aren't familiar with the field.",5,0,,2024,1
802,Comment,18xblpy,what to do about icc mods destroying my grades,POeticPotatoes,2024-01-04 22:16:52+00:00,"I personally believe icc mods are the worst symptom of the problems within NTU's management, and they come with a whole other plethora of issues such as the rigidity of course exemption, lack of feedback on grading criteria and individual performance, prevention of SU post-grade release and more that arise from poor school policies which are frustrating for both students and professors alike (professors in particular, who indeed find ICC as tiresome a chore to teach as many do to learn). The issue can't be solved all at once but leniency should be introduced into the system a step at a time to allow more exemplary students to shine.

I'm a computer science student myself and I do understand what you mean by the ICC mods attempting to teach students the ethics behind technology. What is also interesting is that we do in fact have the ""Engineers in Society"" module which itself was intended to be sufficient to teach engineering students about the moral concepts involved with engineering, meaning that ICC's purpose to an engineering student is already outdone by a more focused and targeted course (or at least it is intended to be that way).

In my opinion, a good first step is to introduce exemption criteria to CC mods that allow students of particular majors to skip content that is already adequately covered in their own courses. If the intention of the school is for students of those disciplines to share their knowledge, then a TA system can be introduced, which allows students in CC mods to learn and interact with other students who are specialists in the field. This would also save many students the burden of carrying their groups in projects that fall into their domain of knowledge, with an end result that may not be representative of their true capabilities (it is silly to judge a specialist in the context of a layman's understanding of their domain, like CC2 tries to do). A second level to this would be the consideration of external qualifications in the exemption critera: for example, exempting students with an A in GP/PW for A levels from CC01 because they are already proficient in academic writing.

The problem of ICC failing to achieve their objectives is a result of two parts: Firstly the fact that a generalised course for all levels of students inevitably caters to its weakest link, and secondly that the room for improvement of each student is severely hindered by our university's strict privacy policies which dictate where when and how professors/tutors are allowed to share information about their grading criteria, and how students are being assessed. The compulsory and graded nature of CC mods means that students are extremely critical of the difficulty level and workload of the module, resulting in the school receiving constant feedback to reduce its taught curriculum and increase its grading leniency. The result is that ICC mods often tend to be completely silly in what they teach because they fear the negative feedback of a student body that is neither interested nor willing to learn a module forced upon them. This also results in the ""rng-esque"" grading of ICC because students are graded on a set of criteria too basic to differentiate most students apart. I have no doubt in my mind that something like CC05 Healthy Living and Wellbeing would be oversubscribed if it was released as a BDE, and tutors would be able to go much further in depth about the topics they are more than qualified to teach about.

As I said, fixing these issues takes time and effort. What frustrates me is the school administration which appears to be doubling down in the rigidity of their system, and failing to understand the harm that it is doing to the student body, especially the danger it presents when students lose confidence in the GPA system to represent their actual level of skill/ capability.",2,0,,2024,1

E.g Accenture, IBM or FANNG - it would be better to skip the recruitment firm. If they are interested in hiring you for a contract position - more often than not, they would still engage a recruitment firm.

Just a personal opinion, at least at the interview stage - you would know what you're getting yourself into, by speaking directly with the hiring manager that is responsible for the team outcome. The hiring manager would at least be from a technical field - and have some clue on the scope of the work, role, function and responsibility of the individual.

If you can, try to avoid IT operation - and I think the trend at the present moment is in A.I, FinTech and Zero-Trust-Architecture (ZTA) platform provider. Try to apply for a few industries that you might be interested - I am sure that your interested is not just solely on one specific industry, and you may try to apply for a few internships as well.

Subject: Student Feedback - Suggestion to Regulate Tourist Groups on NTU Campus

Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to bring attention to a matter that concerns the conducive learning environment at Nanyang Technological University (NTU). As a dedicated student, I have observed a growing issue regarding the unregulated presence of tourist groups on campus.

The influx of tourists, particularly within The Hive & South Spine premises, has begun to impede the learning experience for students. The constant disturbance caused by the presence of large groups affects our ability to concentrate and study effectively. Additionally, the tourists engaging in unauthorized photography of students without consent through the glass windows raises concerns about privacy and personal space within the university setting.

Another noteworthy issue is the bottleneck effect experienced at the South Spine canteen during peak lunchtime periods due to the large number of tourists utilising the facilities. This creates an inconvenience for students who rely on these spaces for their daily meals and breaks.

In light of these challenges, I kindly request the school authorities to take proactive measures to regulate tourist groups on campus. Specifically, I propose the implementation of restrictions on tourist access to certain areas such as the libraries, especially during peak academic periods. Additionally, the school shuttle buses, intended primarily for student transportation, should be limited to students to ensure that their daily commute is not disrupted by the influx of tourists.

By addressing these concerns, we can create a more conducive and focused learning environment for students at NTU. I believe that by carefully regulating tourist activities on campus, we can strike a balance that accommodates visitors while prioritising the educational and welfare needs of the students.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and trust that NTU will take the necessary steps to maintain an optimal learning environment for all students.

Thank you for your consideration. I hope to hear from you soon. 

Sincerely,

[Your Full Name]

So, I don't think I'm going to top the cohort or anything, considering that ICCs would be the difference maker since there's a group of people that can practically guarantee A/A+ for core modules.

981,Comment,19dispc,Friends,Fancy-Ad-835,2024-01-23 14:40:43+00:00,"Year 4 here. Just my opinion. 

I learnt this when i was in poly. Same for uni.

You need to set expectations on what friends there are out there. For me, theres 3 levels of friendships.

Firstly, the school friends. Or same level is, hi-bye friends. They just so happen to be those in school. Talk abit in class.  Maybe jio for lunch for some company. Conversations are usually light hearted and chill. Not so deep and personal but i am still grateful to know them. We talk in class, discusss but i will never likely see them once the class is over. Fyi, i dont have any school friends after each sem is over and im okay with it.

Secondly, casual friends. I see them mostly in ccas, interest groups and classes from outside. These people are a level above from the previously mentioned because we have common interests and feel a sense of belonging and responsibility in each others presence. I can have a certain level of trust and openness to be comfortable around them. But i dont really get close with them because we arent similar on a deeper level.

Then theres my close friends. These are the ones whom i trust. My place of growth. We not only wnjoy each others company but challenge ourselves to be better through a shared purpose that is greater than our ownselves. Id gladly have them over my house for a meal and introduce to my family. Im very open with them, not afraid or reluctant to express myself. I have different friend groups that im very close with. Some i see every week, some once or twice a sem but we still brother lah haha. 

Bottomline is make the effort to know yourself better. When you are comfortable in your own skin and believe in who you are, then your tribe will gravitate towards you vice versa. Im the kind that isnt even bothered to be in a class full of people that has a friend or group they belong with. Why? Because i know who i am and am not fazed by social judgements. How? It takes a long time of feeling uncomfortable and insecure but once you overcome that hurdle, its smooth sailing and you dont feel shackled by other peoples bias/ill-informed opinion of you.",32,0,,2024,1

We might not be super close friends that visit each other, talk about personal topics or even regularly chat online, but we‚Äôll go for lunch together and sit mrt together kind. As uni classes rotate often, you can go 1-2 years without seeing the same people. But usually when u do yall will sit together again. 

My only advice is on the first day of class, get to know the people sitting around you‚Äôll get by fine. Dont be in a rush to get contact numbers, ask if theyre heading home or for lunch after class and if u happen to also be doing the same, then go together.

tw: self-harm, mental illness

I took the mod back in 2021 before I went on loa for major depressive disorder.

I was diagnosed in 2019. since then I attempted suicide 3 times. was warded for long periods as well. I started therapy and taking medication consistently.

got back to school after loa, still trying to cope with life and its difficulties. the previous sem I took the mod again and failed it for the second time.

I feel terrible and awful. next sem is my final sem and if I don't pass it, I won't be able to grad. I'll incur more school fees too.

I feel so guilty and helpless. just wanted to get this off my chest. thank you.

I'm going to assume its a mod that has an exam divided into topics. With the previous notes you have on hand:

Identify the topics you vaguely understand and get a grasp of what you have been struggling with (eg. i partially understand and can apply topic 1-4 but have no idea what topic 12 is about, etc.).Note down your confidence levels somewhere for groups of topics.(Topic 1-4, 5-9 etc.)

If there are tutorials, **write key information beside the qs** to make it easier for reference as tests/exam approaches. If you don't know what info is relevant, then go to class and write down in your own short words (NOT THE ANSWERS) on key steps/info for the answer. Just take a photo of the answers instead. Go back and write down key info beside the question.

As tests approach, re-check your confidence level for the topics going to be tested for. Look at tutorials or sample quizzes provided and answer in your head. Put a tick/cross for ""I know"" and ""I don't know"". Then fill in your information gaps as needed (repeat above step) and practice-practice-practice.

If there isn't enough time to polish everything for test/exams, aim for 3/4 of the test/exam such that you can easily recognise what to do in your head (burn midnight oil if you need to but try to sleep well the day before). Filling in new confusing information (imo) has been detrimental to remembering other topics you already know and WILL kill your confidence, making you second guess everything.

Uhhhh yea, I hope the above is relevant to you. Just remember that confidence is the most important, take small steps and recognise your own small accomplishments. Like, ""wow I got PART of the answer right"", that's GOOD and you should note it down with a pat on the back, seriously. I think that's it if the goal is to just pass, it's worked well for someone dumb like me so far. Wishing you all the best :)",7,0,,2024,1

1054,Post,1afbmyr,"GoParkin in NTU, parking problems and ""There are other carparks in NTU, and there is a campus bus shuttle service available""",cheapbed123,2024-01-31 06:46:18+00:00,"Hi, I just want to share the recent parking situation (since the half of last semester (September 2023), up till now, my motorbike has been clamped a total of 4 times, and I have paid a total of $230 in parking fines.

Well, you might be asking why is this fella not learning his lesson? Honestly, I have tried my best to park at the appropriate lots, but there is just not enough motorcycle lots in NTU. My lessons are usually at Hive building, Carpark Q, there is about only 14 motorcycle lots. The first time I got fined, I parked at the side of the 7 lots, just right beside the lot, where no one is blocked. And  there are also a few motorbikes that are parked beside the lots, on the double yellow line.

[Hive Carpark](https://preview.redd.it/m9798sji1qfc1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fd82e60c8c4ba2f32c73ea5f293eaaa3197324e2)

I called and tried to appeal, as there was really not enough lots, but I was told **""There are other carparks in NTU, and there is a campus bus shuttle service available"".** I was honestly quite frustrated, its as if I bought my motorcycle to come to school, all the way from Tampines, but I am actually not allowed to park?? But at this point, it was fair as South spine carpark B was quite near, a 5 mins walk from Hive. 

However, one day came when I went to both Hive and SS Carpark B, but there was both not enough lots. So I parked ""illegally"", again, just beside the motorcycles, but not an actual lot, but I made very sure I was not blocking anyone. And I walked to hive for my class.

I'm pretty sure most NTU students will walk past South spine carpark, and you can go take a look at the motorcycle parking. It is always full during the day

&#x200B;

[SS Carpark](https://preview.redd.it/8qnm6z4w1qfc1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6c734207e701617b827d84ac849d2c52a9315d3)

This time, my motorcycle was clamped. I called to appeal and they gave me the same reply, **""There are other carparks in NTU, and there is a campus bus shuttle service available"".** Ya but there is REALLY no CARPARKS neaRBY anyMORE. The nearest of which is RTP Carpark, but it only has 7 lots, and I am quite sure it is always occupied by the staff. Same for Gaia Carpark.

I don't stay in hall, so I commute everyday to NTU, but if I can't park in NTU then how do I go to school? Even if I park somewhere else far, how to take campus shuttle?? Everyone knows the damn situation, wait for red bus, 10 179 buses come in a row, then red bus come, cannot go in the bus

I also felt it was very unjust, as the carpark at ARC (Carpark E), all the motorcycle lots are parked on the **small** **PAVEMENT**, which is literally blocking the pedestrians? But I don't see anyone getting fined. So is carpark D (Below McDonalds), where all the Malaysian Bikes just park ""illegally"". But I've never seen any of them getting fined.

How much are these prowlers even paid, there are too hardworking, not a single day where I've not seen a car/motorcycle clamped.

And I'm told that GoParkin is private and independently managed, so we have to lan lan follow their rules, but is it fair to starve someone of a necessity and force high prices? If Singtel was the only network provider service in Singapore, and they made prices insanely high, only the rich would be able to afford internet. 

Is it fair that GoParkin don't provide enough lots, but yet can FINE vehicles that have no other place to park? 

can NTU do something about this please?

About the parking? Or even the campus bus? Can we be more useful? Pretty sure 90% of the campus is well-educated or about to be. Please do something, let SBS take over the campus loops please, there are too many 179s. ",51,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1afbmyr/goparkin_in_ntu_parking_problems_and_there_are/,2024,1

Cross appointments mean nothing. These are 100% in CS and 0% in maths or 100% in maths and 0% in CS. Only joint appointments indicate teaching duties in both departments.

I think it'd be good if CS invites TCS people in SPMS to teach some TCS courses. SPMS can open such courses but the problem is that there may be too few students.

I do still think some subfields of TCS are quite relevant even to the average SWE: algorithms; parallel and distributed computing; programming languages, compilers, and formal methods; and cryptography. Having at least some background in the theoretical side of these topics can help you know where to find answers at least.

Maybe I just don't know what makes the average applied CS researcher/SCSE student tick. If the goal is not to understand the underlying structure of computation and its applications, then what is?

These are kind of separate from algorithm/complexity TCS. Nothing big theoretical has happened in those logic-type theories for a while (it was prosperous until the 1980s). 

The main difference between TCS and applications is that TCS focuses on worst case scenarios. Many problems in application are NP-hard and it is actually provable, for several problems, that even getting a good approximation is NP-hard. With such results, the problem is seen as mostly settled from the TCS perspective, though practice still has strong demand for fast algorithms, heavily optimised for the input that arises in the real world (but these algorithms will still be exponential-time in the worst case and are thus not interested to TCS community). Similarly, TCS doesn't care about the values of the constants hidden in the big-O notation, but applications do.

Real-world programming requires many hacks. Yes, one can learn some from existing theory research (mostly in the 1960s to 1980s), but the research frontier has moved away from the content in Knuth's books. What is closer to real-world programming are programming contests, and indeed, the big IT companies hire many previous contestants.",2,0,,2024,2

??? Homotopy type theory? Univalent foundations? Higher category theory? Computational trinitarianism? There is so much work being done in formal methods right now.

As for the rest of your comment, I have no idea about how the applied side views the work being done on the theoretical side, but isn't a widening gap between the ""two cultures"" a institutional flaw that should be addressed? I'm sure there are lots of insights that can be gleaned from fields such as hardness of approximation, to which I assume you're referring.

> Real-world programming

At the risk of being a bit superlative, programming has very little to do with computer science, even applied stuff.

Well, these developments of formal methods don't really penetrate into many other subfields of TCS. This is ""nothing big"" means. In fact, formal methods are little studied in the TCS community of the US, which is the central location of TCS. The researchers of formal methods are mostly in Europe, but now even Europe has been moving towards the American style of TCS (I don't know why -- possibly the American-style TCS is more vibrant).

> isn't a widening gap between the ""two cultures"" a institutional flaw that should be addressed?

I don't think that's an institutional flaw. It is just the nature of research. I said TCS is like pure maths in spirit.

> I'm sure there are lots of insights that can be gleaned from fields such as hardness of approximation, to which I assume you're referring.

Once you begin to publish papers, you'll know where the interests are. Outside TCS, people like to know what can be done (upper bounds), not what cannot be done (lower bounds). Lower bound papers can hardly get published or noticed by most people. That's how far things can get now. Inside TCS, once you have some upper bound and some impossibility result showing that you cannot do more, people consider the problem closed and would not generally revisit it. People also consider problems closed if there are matching upper and lower bounds (even with difference of small logarithmic factors or huge difference in constants). I know in more applied research, constants do matter a lot, but these are generally addressed -- just how I put it -- by ""hacks"", which are not of research interest in TCS but are something good programming contestants may be good at.",2,0,,2024,2

Theres like a 99.98% chance that the SU only acted on behalf of the uni to manage finaidfriends, making them little more than NTU's postbox AKA zero value add by the SU, and only because finaidfriends was getting in the way of actual work being done. If anyone has the right to get miffed by finaidfriends' post, it should be the people that did the actual work, and not their zero value add postbox lol.

Also, on finaidfriends' post. I'm sure the actual NTU financial aid office did a lot of work in the background - after all, money doesn't just magically appear because some students are upset. While I'm sure the noise made by finaidfriends helped somewhat, their response to NTU releasing the subsidies is quite crass.

From a working adult POV - No one is denying NTU has money, but budgets are allocated at the start of the FY for a reason. If you need more money, it has to come from somewhere for a justified reason.

There was probably an amount that NTU set aside for bursaries and such, and this amount is not arbitrary - its backed by data and trends. A relook at the data to justify the increase would need time, not to mention looking for a source of the additional funds

You don't just move money not within the budget just because ""there's a surplus mah"". Hard to believe, also, that NTU as an organisation would just have millions stagnating in their UOB one account earning 0.01% interest PA. Every cent has a purpose.

No, I don't think the university would let the SU have their hand in the actual budgeting - they have a finance department and actual salaried people for this. So yes you are likely correct that the SU did not, in fact, put in much ""effort"" except for managing finaidfriends.

I can tell you that ""multimillion budget surplus"" NTU, like most large organisations take time to move. You raise an issue, they look into it, and they need time to act on it. Could they have been more transparent and communicated better? Probably. But doesn't change the fact that actual people had to put in hours and nights just to pull this off. Imagine a world where you say we need more bursaries and NTU just implements it the next day just because ""I, NTU student, said so"".

most people working in the real world would tell you the same thing - money and solutions don't magically appear. there's a long behind the scenes process of identifying the issue, meetings upon meetings, setting up a taskforce, then many followed by more meetings and discussions before anything actionable comes out. reason why this is the case because there are checks and balances that need to be met and many administrative red tapes to cross especially if it comes to money.

Also, yes. I stand my ground. What exactly has group done except throw down a list of demands and make noise?

On the brighter side, in my cohort, being in a ""friend group"" meant accepting shitty behaviour such as letting them copy your work, and listen to their daily misogynistic behaviour such as rating random girls based off looks. Obviously this is an extreme example. But based on personal experience, 1-on-1 friendships are better, you get more accurate vibes of the person + deeper rs.

Was ostracised growing up but towards the last 5-6 years of studying i became one of the ‚Äòit‚Äô kids. Had a lot of friendships and even went through tough times with them. After graduation I saw a lot of people change. 

Some due to envy some due to inability to handle stress and others because of romantic entanglements. 

Eventually lost a whole group of ‚Äòreal friends‚Äô when i realised they are not ‚Äòreal‚Äô anymore i guess. Or maybe never was. 

Last 4 places i worked at i had zero work friendships. Last year I started to work on myself, i‚Äôm deeply introverted and hate small talk. But after attending quite a few networking mixers I gained a few friendships that are still thriving. And now in my current job i have two close work friends who work in cross departments.

I guess on the bright side for u, u prolly had more time to studyn do ur own stuffs, and honestly tbh i feel its abt quality of frenship and not about quantity/ where u met them.. .

Once the project ends, say bye bye to them. Likewise for working, the people u meet at work is situational as well. Once ur work project end/work ended, the relationship most likely will end as well. And even if you were to meet them to eat/drink, the only common interest you can have is to gossip about work/boss and is pretty negative in long run. (Negative to mindset)

I will advice you to join interest group where people will work together towards a common goal. At least it will be a positive and wonderful experience rather than making ‚Äòfriend‚Äô at work.

I‚Äôm 31 now and my close friends are still the ones I grew up with, as well as a few I met at work. I drifted from the friends I made in poly + uni. You outgrow people when you grow too :)

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. I've been trying to reach out to my various friends in NTU for awhile now but it seems like everything just dies out. Even my messages asking if we could have a meal to catch-up with each other go ignored. To make matters worse, only one of my mods this sem has mutual friends in it, so for most classes I have to deal with unresponsive groupmates or friend cliques that are described in the paragraph below (for reference, I'm in yr 3 sem 2 rn). 

I understand that my friends are also all busy with assignments and midterms at the moment, so there's that, but the issue is compounded even further by the groupmates I get in the other 4 mods I'm in (that do not have any mutual friends). All of them are just so quiet, and barely say anything during group discussions. They all just keep to themselves even when I make the effort to start the conversation. At least half of them don't even bother acknowledging me when I say a simple hello when entering the class. Then there are those who just chat among themselves, EVEN DURING GROUP DISCUSSIONS, because they are mutual friends who already knew each other outside of class, and I'm just the only guy left excluded. I kid you not, I have opened a conversation multiple times with these types of people I just mentioned, and at most a total of like THREE SENTENCES will be said and that's it, they just immediately go back to discussing the topic among themselves only. Fk me honestly. 

I feel so awfully lonely right now. It's not like I don't make the effort to make friends. Those who know me well will even know me as an extremely outspoken person, especially in groupwork and presentations, but I'm just running dry. I even make the effort to dress more nicely (so I don't just blend in even more into the stereotype of guys who only wear shirts and shorts) and nothing works. I make sure I always dress neatly and groom myself nicely, because that also affects how approachable I am. I make genuine efforts to try and connect, made even more difficult by the fact that I am the quiet type (with past trauma from bullying), but no one responds in kind. 

I'm just so tired, so frustrated, in an almost indescribable way. I want to cry. I thought I would finally get the chance to have some quality interactions with my friends and make more new friends after a horrible semester-long internship last semester (I'm literally going to a government agency this coming Monday for a scheduled mediation session because the company STILL HAS NOT PAID ME PROPERLY) but clearly that has not been how things are going. I have not seen any of my friends since, like, August 2023??? 

I'm just sad right now. I wish this computer that I am typing on right now was a person I can talk to. I'm dying inside. ",247,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1b27xb1/this_semester_is_my_loneliest_ever_and_i_hate_it/,2024,2

I have talked about this with a few of my friends and they too struggled with just how hard it is to make friends in a university setting.

Truth is, most relationships with project group mates are purely transactional. If it's a module that allows for self grouping, you can be sure that 80% of groups are formed by friends and you are just there to fulfill the 4/5 member requirement. It is almost impossible to befriend them because everyone would just stick to their own comfort zone.

Even if you thought that you got along really well with a particular group mate last semester, it may just be that they wanted to establish a good working relationship with you. After the project, there is no longer that incentive for them to entertain you. This is the hard truth.

The best way to make actual friends would be to join as many CCAs as possible and see which one has the people that vibe with you. In a less academic and more casual setting, people are more willing to make small talk and hangout. It works even better when you join during recruitment season as there would be many others who are there to make friends, and cliques haven't been formed yet.",43,0,,2024,2

Friends are people that will make time for you when you need them, they are also people who will volunteer their help without you asking when you need help. I have around a dozen of them and l really treasure my relationship with them. 

The rest of them are just people who come in and out of my life. I will not be unfriendly to them, socialize with them and offer help if l am able to. But one day if they float out of my life. I will not be hurt too. You will find plenty of these people once you start working. 

It is your family including your relatives that are with you forever. So if you are close to them, l will advise you to hang out with them more. I hang out with my siblings and cousins a lots. And of cos l am blessed to have a dozen friends too. To me, my BFF shld always be my wife.

347,Comment,1b27xb1,This semester is my loneliest ever and I hate it,Natural_Interaction,2024-02-28 18:08:09+00:00,"I think you can try a different tack here.

1. You cannot control the behaviour of others but you can always choose how you want to respond to it. I.e. If those group members prefer to mingle around by themselves during group discussion (I'm assuming you are referring to those in-class discussions), that's actually totally fine. But when it comes down to the group work for project submissions (which everyone has to take part), take a slightly more active role by doing small things, like setting up meeting dates and do some coordination work, your presence will be felt and they will warm up to you.
2. I have to be a little blunt here -- dressing and grooming well does not necessarily equate to being approachable. Although it's good on your part for doing that because it's a form of respect to your professors and peers.
3. I think you should learn to manage your expectation for friendships in general. Friendships can flip between ""active"" and ""dormant"" state depending on many factors (e.g. how long you have known them, how you get to know them, etc). Don't put unnecessary pressure on yourself just because a friendship didn't turn out how you desire to be.
4. You can try other things to let people warm up to you. (e.g. When you are walking to another class and you happen to see them, just wave to say hello. Or do some small talks like how's your day, etc)

But if you do need professional help, you can contact [UCC](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/life-at-ntu/student-life/ntu-wellbeing/contact-us) for assistance. Service is free for NTU students. :\]",3,0,,2024,2

I also had friends from outside of uni so it didn't matter to me)I'd say perhaps you making the effort can come off feeling as kind of a burden to your groupmates. 

Some people need time to get closer with one another, rather than just barging your way into trying to form a connection asap.

I'm just speaking from my personal experience as I'm more quiet and introverted (with new people. im pretty loud with my friends) and I've had people who were extremely friendly from the get go and honestly its a turnoff for me.

Another thing for me was that some people would always try to bring me out of my shell and would also question why I was so quiet. This was an annoyance to me as i always felt that everyone is different and that people just couldnt get over this fact. 

You've mentioned that you're a more quiet person but tries your best to genuinely make new friends. A food for thought is, how do you really come off as? You dressing up well etc. to come off as approachable are things from your perspective. Do people really view you in the same light? 

I'd recommend just being yourself. You being naturally more quiet and reserved but putting in an effort to pretend you're not might actually be giving off the wrong vibes to people (people are able to tell sometimes if its an act). 

There are people who will appreciate your efforts but there will also be people who don't and would prefer a more natural and slow approach.

Take your time rather than trying to force a connection with people. Not everyone will be your cup of tea and neither will you be everyone's type of friend. 

As mentioned, everyone is different. Rather than harping on the fact that your groupmates are too quiet and exclusive, in the future, maybe just acknowledge it and then move on? There's no need to put in too much of an effort.  Just be yourself and let things flow naturally (not saying you should put 0 effort in but you joining a club or cca is already an effort. Let the rest happen naturally by itself). 

The people around here have mentioned joining a cca in school. Maybe you could also look for lessons outside of school (e.g. language classes or art classes)?",2,0,,2024,2

The people that reject your hospitality are NOT the people you want to be friends with, don't force it. However, the moment someone DOES accept your hospitality, cling onto that opportunity with ur life. It may or may not be obvious, but you can definitely feel it.

Nevertheless, if school doesn't work, try outside communities. There's youth corps Singapore, or mayb some part time job that involves networking with peers? idk. Volunteering/job/outside hobbies like mayb boxing or martial arts at public gym classes? Bouldering, hiking groups?

Do abuse the free counselling (if they have) regarding matters like this. They may help provide insights from their experience.

I would like to share my thoughts, as a Y1S2, about making friends in uni and hope it might help you somehow.

First of all, university is a place where many, perhaps including me, come to get a degree. Other things, such as friends and CCAs are not a priority, unfortunately. To make things worse, the uni's system does not make it easy to keep in contact with friends you have made in previous semester as you've pointed out in your post. This system probably trains us to work with new people and separate school life from personal life which is similar to how it'll be like in the workforce. This might explain why you meet more ""project mates"" rather than ""friends"".

Personally, I too wanted to make friends during my previous semester but I soon realise that it would be difficult to make even one friend, let alone maintaining it for 3+ years. But I've come to terms with this sad reality and shifted my focus to academics rather than friendship. However, if I ever found my people, I would put more effort into maintaining the relationship. Relationships take two hands to clap, after all. Many people graduate university without making a friend and I believe, as a quiet & socially awkward guy, I will be one of them as well. 

Despite the sad truth, I was able to come to terms with it because of the school's counselling and PHP. If you feel like it, you could schedule an appointment and best part is, it's free. Google NTU counselling and you should be able to proceed from there. Apart from that, CCAs and hall activities seem to be the easiest way to make and maintain friendships but it'll be difficult to join one at this stage(but not impossible) so you could always try joining a CCA/attend the events you like. I'm also curious to know more people so drop me a text if you like (even though I'm not the most interesting person either :/).

Some suggestions I have for you right now are to think about why you're so keen to make/hang out with friends and do you think you'll be able to cope without them, why or why not. Pen down your thoughts. List down activities you enjoy doing and then find out if NTU offers anything similar.

Though I still feel some sense of bitterness ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt I have friends in Uni‚Äù ‚Äúthis I was not what I expected Uni to be like‚Äù and seeing everybody have meaningful and close friendships that we dont have can make these feelings of bitterness to exacerbate. I have tried to be more outspoken when it literally goes against every introverted cell in my body cause I was so desperate for someone I could call a friend. But I think at some point, I just come to accept that I can be alone. While yes, having friends is part of our nature as humans but I think that having confidence in being alone is quite liberating. When you are comfortable with being yourself alone, you can learn to connect with others. But not to say you should stop seeking friendship, I think the people you can call friends would come eventually just need to be patient   I wish you all the best!",1,0,,2024,2

Sometimes, not everyone out there are your ""friends"". Some people are just hi-bye, some are just to do projects or work, some are friends you can talk and joke for long periods of time. I guess that is how human nature works.

You have to find your type of people. For me, I make some jokes, just try to ""small talk"" and evaluate their responses/interest. While I want to expand my network as much as possible, I dont see a reason to waste my energy on people who are not interests.

Perhaps, try joining some interests group of what you like, at least you can try share some common interests. For me, I found many tight-knitted friends in band compared to uni(ppl are really busy and they keep changing for each class). Most importantly, use these opportunities to network with them. Lol like seriously, I went to this year's airshow and apparently, one of my band friend's dad is a manager at one of the companies. Haha it is a small country üòÇ",1,0,,2024,2

I think lots of helpful advice has been given here already about class friendships being transactional, about reconsidering those who don‚Äôt give your their attention as friends, and about joining cca to get more friends instead. Would like to chime in on the cca thing - that really worked for me, I found that most of the people whom I met in cca were much more open and welcome to being friends and it was far easier to talk with them about interests, hobbies and life :) I‚Äôm not sure how much time you have left, but it‚Äôs never too late to join a cca! :D

That aside, also bear in mind that you simply won‚Äôt be able to vibe with everybody. That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing, and neither is it reflective of how approachable you are: it‚Äôs just the way people work. You‚Äôre also not likely to get along with or be interested in absolutely everyone you meet either.

I had a very troubled past due to lots of bullying and ostracising, which was exacerbated by both of my exes in the past cheating on me (with one leaving me during my IB years, right before NS). This caused me to become both very depressed and sucidal back then, so I left my previous school with basically zero friends (I was in the IP programme, so I did sec1-4 and IB yr1-2 in the same school, and it meant I could never truly distance myself from my past).

This led to me entering NS in an extremely troubled state, with unsupportive parents who didn't understand I was going through very real troubles, so I also left NS with zero friends as well.

Previous groupmates from previous semesters have personally told me that I come off as a very nice guy, and very approachable and practical, and one of them has even told me before that the way I carry myself comes off as ""high class"", but not in a snobbish way, rather a respectable and reserved mannerism, and this same friend has continued to occasionally offer his help whenever I needed it (most recently when I posted a question into my major's combined group chat and he PMed me to help me directly). 

I think you're reading too much into the part where I try to engage people. You know those in-class group discussions where u're supposed to be discussing with people? I kid you not when I say that in 4 of my mods this semester (except the 1 mod where I already have mutual friends), I am forced to start the conversation, if not the group would get absolutely nothing done and have nothing to contribute for the subsequent class discussion. 

I'm very keenly aware if I am a burden on my groupmates when trying to engage. Due to my background, I am actually **too** aware of moods and temperaments, so very rarely will I over-engage to the point of driving people away.

This rant is more based around the fact that I have seemingly run out of people to talk to.

since you‚Äôre the quiet type (i am too, so ill recommend what i think is good for quiet people lol), look into joining wholesome clubs like board games, photography, the lesser known wsc divisions, astronomy, etc. 

i really recommend board games bc i know a lot of wholesome quiet nice people who play board games LOL even though personally i didn‚Äôt join any board game clubs due to distance. but from a quick ig check at ntu_fastforward, I don‚Äôt think you need to sign up or anything, you can just turn up for any session (do give them a dm to check first tho) 

it‚Äôs very very difficult to make friends from classes since that‚Äôs just the nature of uni.. you see each other for a few sems and drift apart. these are friendships of convenience, i also had some suuuper close friends from poly who just didn‚Äôt make any effort to meet anymore after grad, since there was no more factor of convenience. it‚Äôs just like this ba.. so, joining a club will be ur best bet!",8,0,,2024,2

from my experience, i'd say things like making friends take time, but what you need is also just a change of environment since you shouldn't rely on ""fate"" to get things going for you. just my two cents, there's many ways to make friends and it's important you don't focus on just your school setting to help with that since people tend to stick to whoever they know already. i think you can consider finding communities with the same interests as you, whether that's IRL interest groups or discord servers etc. anyway i truly believe you can do it, all the best and don't give up! :)",2,0,,2024,2

However, SU ‚Äúmet up‚Äù with them and just sniped their idea, placing the SU logo behind the initiative. 

We have all seen how hard finaidfriends pushed for various policy changes, wrote proposals and endured countless meetings with the school for these changes.

And SU, without a single piece of care and effort, simply passed these changes off as their own in their new Instagram post, without crediting the efforts of student movements that pushed for these changes.

We need student initatives in the first place because we have a student union that does nothing but suck our school fees.

Irrelevant to the course you are taking. No need to elaborate 

Killing direct year 2 internships. From 20 weeks to 10 weeks. Not sure if it's true but when the school introduced CC mods the Dy2 internships changed to 10 weeks in duration. like bro is learning to write an op Ed more important?

As it is, many diploma holders are already crying unfair asking why degree holders are paid higher than diploma holders when arguably diploma holders have more working experience since they enter the Industry earlier. 

One common argument against the above is that university graduates are supposed to be trained to eventually take on management roles, that‚Äôs why their education needs to be more well-rounded and cross-cutting with domain knowledge in different fields of knowledge. Eg. Let‚Äôs take management roles of a hospital for example. Imagine if you are the CEO, you kind of need to know a bit of everything, from the technical aspects ranging from medical equipment, medicines, cutting-edge research etc to the less technical aspects like people management, comms, policy-making, etc. They cannot merely be technical experts. 

So if you are doing badly in every single CC module in uni but doing well in your core mods then honestly you should be quite concerned because that means your current skillsets are quite skewed which is actually not the point of a well-rounded uni education, really.",33,0,,2024,2

Struggles are either where you grow the most or simply sink. 

If we fail to recognise this, then SG uni graduates will fail to be adequately competitive in the international arena where the most illustrious candidates are able to draw insights from different domains of knowledge and are also articulate enough to express concepts they had synthesised from different knowledge fields. 

This is not an ego argument. This is an argument as to whether SG students recognise for themselves how dangerously close they are to being usurped by people from countries way hungrier than them, more innovative because of exposure to different fields AND are cheaper to hire to boot. Anyone who is still looking to be a silo domain expert in the era of artificial intelligence is really stupid and will be forced to confront the truth soon in the workplace. 

But it‚Äôs ok. I‚Äôm already comforted by the fact that more people understood what I was talking about in my initial post (30 upvotes) and those who are whining at NTU like entitled idiots for having non-core mods, have already outed themselves as being too close-minded and weak! to even attempt to fight to keep up with competition.

this doesn't appeal to gen Z anymore.

Bird in the hand is better than 2 in the bush.

Lots of them tried to jump to high finance / MAPs/ Consulting / Banks / Government which can easily get 4.5k to 6k.

By 30, if accountancy student went to big4, they are only managers (for males due to NS), and get 7k? 

Meanwhile, grads who jumped into banks or MAPs already getting 6k at the age of 24 or 25. By 30, i believe they will receive promotion and they can hop jobs and ask for higher.

That idea (start low but grow fast) was somewhat acceptable to those of us from 10 years ago. There weren‚Äôt many better alternatives.

Ofc EEE also can have various paths in the future but idk much about them , just from what I see, my acquaintances all go engineering and the pay is so so 

And I also feel physics smaller cohort more personal ? Like the prof to student ratio as compared to EEE . Plus there is many paths to study as well , like you can go the more analytical ones like models and maths with some physics things , or you can go the nano path which is what I did cause I like it , or biophysics etc lo . So yea physics/applied physics is the better choice if you ask me just cause the wide variety of choices and paths you can choose from.

Ofc can also become a jack of trades situation (wide breadth but shallow depth) but the path forward should be up to your personal development and for you to find interest in your career in the future le , uni is just for you to see and know what's out there and what are the paths you have interest in",3,0,,2024,2

In addition, 10 years ago, the starting pay is still pretty good at that time of the cost of living. To be very honest, big4 starting pay rising very slowly and does not justify the inflation in our current environment. 

Now in this tech era, all information is almost online. People can read forums, reviews, job descriptions, and culture. Hence, people can decide on these alternatives too. Likewise, other industry HR also source the talents from accountancy, which resulted in lesser people joining big4.

Now, all the good candidates can start off with a salary that is comparable to Senior / Manager level in big4 and better working conditions. 

In big4, they have to deal with clients and their managers. Being in the position of middle man, the pay doesn't justify it lah hahaha.",2,0,,2024,2

The problem is some of the faculties already have these. Like for e.g. SSS, CCEB and SPMS has ""ambassadorial groups"" where they do tours within the faculties, even for students overseas.

Whoever designed this system very likely thought that very few people who were not students or staff would even bother taking the campus riders, so it would not be worth the effort installing any form of identification system, but that then leaves the system open to unexpected abuse (which we see right now from the tourists).

Even if NTU is a public campus, that doesn't mean we let the public freely use the things that have been paid for by students.

The implementation process being a hassle is not an excuse to just let the system be open to abuse. Students should not be getting crowded out of the buses we paid for. 

Also, implementing a guest pass for official guests that visit NTU is not difficult. Places that are usually sealed off to the public already have so many examples of guest ID passes for NTU to just directly copy.

I am of the opinion that just because NTU is a public campus, does not mean we allow foreigners to abuse the system and deprive students of the facilities designed specifically for us in mind.

Implementing checks and balances will always result in additional hassle, no matter where you are in the world or what you do, but they exist for good reason. Tourists will not obey the signboards that NTU has put up, because they know that enforcement is non-existent and it's almost impossible to identify a tourist based on looks alone.",10,0,,2024,2

Of course, like other people and myself have brought up in other comments, it will be a hassle and cost resources, but that is simply the cost of properly taking care of your campus assets (said assets being the roads, buses, buildings, land area, etc). 

It is the job of the university to ensure that the usage of campus resources meant for students' and staffs' convenience are not abused by tourists and other outsiders. This is especially crucial when aforementioned outsiders start disrupting the daily campus life of students.",6,0,,2024,2
768,Comment,1alsyag,is it just me or there is still alot of tourist in NTU,CheesecakeOG,2024-02-09 08:25:45+00:00,"My point still stands.

In fact, MOE paying the majority of the fees is an even greater argument for why the uni shld strictly control the usage of campus resources by tourists. Why should facilities funded by the government's leading education ministry for the betterment of enrolled students be used and abused freely by tourists?

You're also forgetting about NTU's foreign students, who receive no subsidy whatsoever unless they are on scholarship or financial aid (idk if foreign students can even qualify for financial aid), so they are paying the full amount. 

Bottom line, it doesn't matter who is the one actually paying. These facilities were funded and designed *for* students and staff, not for outsiders to freely use and disrupt the learning environment (apparently, some tourists have gone so far as to join ongoing lectures, and I have personally had the displeasure of observing tourists crowding the buses, taking pictures of classes at Hive, and even crowding the TCT bus stop with their own tour buses, preventing green line campus riders from making their stops).",2,0,,2024,2

772,Comment,1alsyag,is it just me or there is still alot of tourist in NTU,CheesecakeOG,2024-02-08 16:20:15+00:00,"That's not correct.

""Not enough buses"" and ""tourists using the resources paid for by students"" are two different problems that have to be solved individually.

Sure, if u increase the number of buses significantly on every campus rider line, the congestion issue will basically resolve itself. *However, that still does not change the fact that tourists and outsiders are using university resources for free*. 

Compare it to a Condo MCST fee or HDB season parking fee. No matter how much space there is, would u be entirely, 100% agreeable to outsiders using your HDB season parking lots or Condo facilities for free? You paid for them, so why should outsiders be allowed to use them for free? It's a basic principle of fairness. 

Not to mention, tourists cause more issues than just crowding the buses. Many NTU redditors have mentioned tourists making lunchtime crowds worse, making noise and disrupting classes, even entering lecture halls in the middle of ongoing lectures, privacy concerns from them constantly snapping photos of students in class at the Hive, etc.

Whatever I am saying here sounds harsh, but I am simply making a firm stand based on the principle of fairness. If the campus buses are a fully public resource that is fully sponsored by the uni and the students did not pay a single cent towards its operation, then fine, the uni has full authority to dictate its usage. However, as students who paid for the privilege to have a campus rider ferry us to our classes, we should not at all be sharing an exclusive resource with outsiders.",3,0,,2024,2

The government pays part of our uni fees. Our fees do not cover the full cost of all these services. It's not the same as HDB or Condo. I agree with the point made about tourists causing issues though. As we are a public university, we can't close the uni off from people who want to visit and do you think a small fee like $1 will stop them from crowding our buses?

For art can check out the local museums, there are also lesser known ones like lee kong chian @ NUS. Art community is full of super fun pop-ups - can follow time out SG on insta for the latest.


Nature, would totally recommend sungei buloh and intertidal walks at changi beach. Can look out for guided tours by 
- herpetological society singapore (free, once a month so runs out very fast)
- the curious pangolin (paid, insect & nature trails)
- wandering.octopod (paid, intertidal walk)


You could say try out unique bus routes that are very scenic (+ its a cheap option) https://www.timeout.com/singapore/things-to-do/the-most-scenic-bus-routes-in-singapore

793,Comment,1aosh7v,Where're the non landmark place to visit in Singapore? I'm exchange student,WGkeon,2024-02-12 12:09:43+00:00,"I am not sure whether Tangjong Pagar is considered landmark or not but I like it on a late afternoon stroll when the sun is not shining too brightly. It is a nice place to appreciate the old Singaporean architecture while enjoying the artsy vibe going on in the area as there is a lot of cafes and galleries there. One cool cafe is Slow boat on Craig road, its a vinyl listening cafe.

So my usual course would be exiting outram park mrt station at the exit that is the nearest to Outram Park's North East Line platform (Purple Line) right outside the exit would be Pipes by ÂÖ´Â§©Â†Ç, good place with good food and coffee, they have Japanese-cafe closing time so they close at 6pm, after that walk down Teo Hong road, the first shop on the block of building on your left would be 99 old tree durian, good place to try Durians if you are afraid of the smell of real durian, they sell mostly Durian desserts, I guess that soften the experience a bit. Next on the same block of building is The Fluxus house, a hair salon combined with an art gallery, nice place to admire from the outside ( It is a Japanese Hair salon and almost all their stylist are Japanese).

Walk down Teo Hong road somemore, you will reach Bukit Pasoh road. At the block of building across the road, there is Grassroots Book room, a small cozy mainly Chinese books book store however, they sell nice stationary and cute stuff. Following Teo Hong road, you will reach Neil road ( Before reaching Neil road, there will be a walkthrough through a building into a park and on to Keong Saik road, both ways are fine depending on how easy you get lost) at Neil road, turn left and walk until you see shake shack and The capitol, turn left into Keong Saik road.

On Keong Saik road, there is Coach Cafe. It is a museum/cafe that is all about Coach (the branded goods brand) pretty nice place to rest for awhile, at the mid point of Keong Saik road, there is potato head/Three buns selling arguably the best burger in Singapore, if you dont feel like having burgers, at the next junction of Keong Saik road, you will see Kreta Ayer road, turn right.

At Kreta Ayer road, there are Korean restaurants, at here you will be entering the fringes of Singapore's Korea town. If you follow this road, you will reach back to Neil road, across the street on the left you will see a road that goes into Duxton road, where all the bars and most of the Korean restaurants are, however if you turn right and go down Neil road, you will reach Shake shack again which will be across the road on your right. If you cross over to Shake Shack and walk down the road there which is Craig road, at the end of it will be the other end of Singapore's Korean town.

At this point, either continue on and Tanjong Pagar Mrt will be the place where you board the Mrt again or walk back towards Outram Park. At one of the entrance to Tanjong Pagar MRT , there is Guoco Tower, it is an office tower but the first floor there has a large area with chairs and huge fans for rest, it is windy and a lot of restaurants. Nice place to rest there while eating cakes or ice cream from „Ç∑„É£„Éà„É¨„Éº„Çº nearby.

And this is my recommendations",3,0,,2024,2

I think here are some places you can visit:
- Clarke Quay, there is Singapore River (you can sit beside the river to eat), iFlyer, some restaurants, and if you enjoy night life there are many bars
- bicycle ride or walk at Coney Island. Beautiful scenery and has a small beach! Make sure to hold your bags properly; there are monkeys which will steal bags. Bring insect repellant.
- Geylang is considered red light district but there is good food there 
- Holland Village for food
- Orchard Road, Somerset and Dhoby Ghaut area. Shopping district. Lots to see if you want to shop, there's also cafe and izakaya in the area.
- Bugis area. Has shopping, good Mediterranean food, and there is a space called Curbside Crafters where local creators and makers sell their handmade items. You can also go on the heritage trail.
- Marina Barrage. People go there to fly kites, roller blade, and you can also cross the bridge to see a small pier
- Sembawang Hot Spring Park, our only natural hot spring. The area is modified for leg soaking and cooking egg (like onsen tamago). Open from 7am-7pm.  For full body soak there is Yunomori Onsen located at Kallang.

- Start at Chinatown for Ri Ri Hong Mala Hotpot
- Head over to Rifle Range Park, accessible from Beauty World shopping centre. This is a gorgeous, easy trek and you can spend lots of time in here. Spent about 3.5h in here yesterday - if you're feeling ambitious, Bukit timah is just next door as well. 
- Dinner at Little India

Some other itineraries that I've brought visiting friends on: 

You can easily spend an entire afternoon exploring the Chinatown/Tanjong Pagar/Club St/Duxton/Keong Saik area. Lots of street murals and temple, shophouse architecture to spot, plenty of great cafes to pop into, and you'll pass by Maxwell and Amoy - famed hawker centres. And don't miss the Chinese tea houses like tea chapter and yixing yuan for a Chinese tea experience.

And make a day of exploring the southern islands or pilau ubin (bring a picnic and a frisbee/volleyball, and lots of sunscreen) - easily accessible and tons of guides online. 

I would also recommend keeping an eye out for weekly activities. Publications like TimeOut SG, Honeycombers, LifestyleAsia etc have weekly lists of things to do, published usually from Wed to Fri. You'll have so much to do!

And if all else fails, in your time on exchange, plan for some jaunts to nearby JB, Batam, BKK, etc based on your budget and appetite.

Many companies immediately reject me even without offering a chance for interview due to my citizenship. P&G rejected me within 2 hours after my application. 

I know I am not the cream of the crop in my degree, however, I do imagine more opportunities for job. Especially having signed the tuition grant stating I need to work in SG for 3 years after graduating. 

It‚Äôs just very discouraging to be in this situation. I need to fulfil the bond yet not having many job opportunities due to bad economies. 

I have been here for 20 years, however PR application was never successful (came from quite an underprivileged background), and without finding a good job, I don‚Äôt know if I can get out of this situation.

There is a ratio for Singaporean and PR to foreigners that a company can hire. This ratio is industry dependent, and in general the more low-skilled physical jobs, the more foreigners the company can hire.

The white collar jobs that uni grads want have a lower ratio, so to hire one more foreigner, they must have multiples more Singaporeans or PR in the company. 

Also, the country you are from as a foreigner status matters too. For the company I work at, Malaysians are possible to hire but others like China and India are not. I think the ratio might be different but this I can't confirm.",8,0,,2024,2

Some argue that the mainland Chinese are overreacting, well, have you heard of Koreans having successfully registered dragon boat festival as their heritage with UNESCO? 

Not familiar? Then it's worth noting that Seoul as the capital city of South Korea had always been called Ê±âÂüé in Chinese (translated from its old name Hanseong) until 2005 when the city government designed and formalised its name in Chinese as È¶ñÂ∞î (Sh√¥u√är), a direct translation from the pronunciation of Seoul. The literal meaning of Ê±âÂüé is Chinese city or a city of the Chinese. You can't argue that these are coincidences, not deliberate moves to form their own culture identity, I'm not saying it's wrong to do so. 

However, pushing a name change from CNY to LNY is a different story. It has never been the case whereby non-Chinese shall not celebrate CNY. Again, it's CNY and has always been. If you think you should not celebrate CNY, then don't.",5,0,,2024,2

I think if you are Chinese, and the context by which you are referring to the new year is also Chinese, then CNY is fine. LNY just passes off as trying to be politically correct, which I really hate. Of course, if the context is Korean or Vietnamese, then it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to use the actual names of their new years (Seollal or¬†T·∫øt).¬†

Honestly, it‚Äôs all about the intent. In natural conversation, people with common sense don‚Äôt just intend to be racist by something as trivial as ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù New Year.

(Apologies to non-Chinese for not providing a translation)

If you read up on Chinese history, the idea of New Year has never been static. Every Emperor moves the definition of New Year. The ‚ÄúChinese‚Äù or more correctly farmer calendar is lunisolar calendar because of 24 solar terms which is far more accurate for farming seasons than the moon even though the moon is easier for dating. Modern Chinese citizens are either clueless or political about it.

Â≤ÅËäÇ = Á´ãÊò• = Âè§‰ª£ÂÖÉÊó¶ = ÁîüËÇñ‰∫§ÊõøÊó•

Âπ¥ËäÇ = ÂÜúÂéÜÊ≠£ÊúàÂàù‰∏Ä Êàñ ÂÜúÂéÜ12ÊúàÂàù‰∏Ä

Because Á´ãÊò• is not the first solar term, but is rather 3 or 4 Feb, and ÂÜúÂéÜÊ≠£ÊúàÂàù‰∏Ä is usually close by, that was never a problem until the Gregorian calendar was adopted.",3,0,,2024,2

PSP Scholars benefit from the Scholars' Priority Scheme, however, the success of allocation still depends on the ranking of choices and available vacancies.  Please refer to the Scholars Guarantee for more information. Nanyang Scholars would then be allocated with a certain cap requirement.

Citizenship: Singaporeans > Singaporean Permanent Residents > International students. Do note that ranking of choices, CGPA, and availability of vacancies have an impact on allocation.

Academic Performance Applicants with comparatively lower CGPAs should be mindful of ranking only top-tier universities with limited spots. Students are advised to consider universities with vacancies of at least 20 or more

This statement is not true. The budget doesn't have to be spent on Pen&Inc. And the statement suggests that there is a budget for every single team bonding and meeting which again is not true.

As a student of NTU, I would like to bring to your attention the current situation that many students are aggrieved by. There has been a huge influx of tourists on the school compound. 

In the hive, tourists would go to levels above B4 and come in large groups. They also take pictures of students during lessons and make us to feel like zoo animals. In South Spine food court, they take up precious seats and lengthen queues for students who have limited time to eat between classes. In libraries, they disrupt students who are there to study. 

Overall, many students are unhappy with the current state of things. The school is no longer a conducive place for us to study and grow, but instead, has become a tourist attraction that distracts everyone. 

I hope this email has found you well, and that regulations can be put in place to properly reduce the disturbances caused by these tourists on the students of NTU. 

Yours sincerely,

Am a fresh grad whos in the workforce for 9mths ish now!

1. possible, but chances of successfully negotiating to the pay you want is low, since MA/GP usually have a fixed starting salary. (imagine another fresh grad come in with u same course same grade but salary higher than u by few hundreds, doesnt fit)

2. Should nego, if u think u can bring more to the table. Typically not MA/GP program since they gna treat everyone equally and train them tgt. For specific roles if you have other offers, you can use it to nego, but becareful not to High ball the HR. They have plenty of candidates to choose from tbh.

3. Usually employers will peg it to your last salary. sad truth but its a rough gauge of what u have brought to the table for your last company. For high starting point, what is your range? To me 5k is a good starting point for fresh grad already. Any salary near that im okay. It boils down to your comfort level.

4. GES is definitely inflated. Students who didnt do well for acads/jobless still will not do the survey. Student who did okay for acads/found a good job will do the survey. But its still a good enough indicator imo. 

5. Look at the jobscope illustrated, talk to the HR, ask HR questions on work culture, work timing, flexible working hours, benefits and welfare, Bonus etc. I have friens who do lesser than me but earns more than me. Again it boils down to what makes u comfortable.",2,0,,2024,2

4. The GES is for 2022 is quite long ago alr so maybe not

5. True value is in the eye of beholder. Even though my salary is low my 3 girlfriends all love me very much and say I am amazing soul. So true value is high despite low income. True value can be calculated using this formula: 

(Current salary + # of girlfriends *10,000)

I honestly think both SS and NS canteen foods are mid as hell, especially the caifan stalls. You ask any hall dweller where to get caifan, it's always Hall 11 grumpy uncle, or Mala wise it's always a debate between the hall canteens but never the Mala from SS/NS. Honestly the only saving grace are the drinks that are still occasionally decent, though I don't understand why NS drinks are more expensive than SS drinks when both are run by Koufu (pardon me if I'm wrong).

Caifan at SS is a rip off. You have no idea how much each portion is until it's tallied up at the cashier, and by then it's too late. If you ask how much each portion is as you order you'll piss people off. I once ordered a three dish meal (cabbage, sweet and sour meat, some mincemeat beancurd fry). At the cashier, the rice, cabbage and sweet and sour meat came up to $3.2. reasonable. And then the price jumped to $6.2 due to the mincemeat beancurd fry dish. I asked and they said yeah it's $3 a portion, BECAUSE there's dried shrimps inside so it's a fish dish. This dish was placed amongst your usual caifan dishes, with no clear indication that it's gonna be an expensive dish. I swear they're out for your money.

Also, dishes are cold or lukewarm at best if you don't buy them by lunchtime (and even then, some dishes are still COLD). I've given the stall multiple chances over my 4 years here (final sem student) and I honestly can say that if the stall was the last one open for dinner, I would just endure the hunger and order Dingo supper much later.",24,0,,2024,2

They literally put a hyperlink on the movement there, but completely missed the entire point of it. 

I don't know why they went with a smart aleck guilt tripping tone with their messaging, it might genuinely be the worst possible way to spread awareness. Like seriously, who in their group thought leaving a PS message was a good idea?

This poorly thought out bulletin board also now serves as ammo for those looking to spread the complete opposite message. Someone can easily pick this story up, and run with it to preach a whole different thing.

And I'm not sure if they're aware, but they live in Singapore. We have close relations with the star, not the watermelon. So what happens when two countries have close relations with each other? They collaborate. The local universities here WILL have ties with them, it's just a fact. The things you use, the things you look at and the things you eat have most definitely had a close contact with the country you loathe due to the sheer scale of it all.

Good intentions can only get you so far. This was a poor showing. Sigh.",52,0,,2024,3

McDonald‚Äôs Israel did donate food to the Israel army, but McDonald‚Äôs Egypt, Turkey, Oman and a ton of other McDonald‚Äôs disavowed this action, put out their own statement supporting Gaza, and donated millions of dollars to Gaza.

Almost like McDonald‚Äôs is a franchise where licensees act individually. And by boycotting all McDonald‚Äôs, including Muslim ones that support and donate to Gaza, you‚Äôre against humanitarian aid in Gaza???

Israel is faced with an impossible situation when they want all of:

2) a state that is democratic;
3) a state that encompasses all of ancient Israel

NTU's support for Israel is well documented, as stated here. And Israel, is definitely killing civilians, aligning with definiton of genocide, so NTU is complicit. The poster is not blaming u for this, it is empowering you to know this. Knowledge is power, critical thinking is in short supply. Pls set aside your ego, and consider this objectively. 

2. Why are ppl here making this a religious issue? Ask yourself this - yes, religion might tether some ppl here to the tragedy, but do u really think ppl are voicing out their opinons cuz of their religion? Or are they seeing ppl murdered and advocating for a stop? If you are informed by a patriotic sense of duty to nation, making you analyse this with a relgious lens -- arent you informed by a religious fervour to your nation more than ppl are infleunced by religion to stop civilains dying?

3. Lastly, how did this comment make you feel? Are you offended? Why? Is it because I am challening your beliefs or as someone here put it, being ""fanatical to the Palestinian side"".  Why is being against killing civilians fanatism? And before anyone brings this talking point up - I am against the killing of civilains in all sides. I condemn Hamas, and I condemn Bibi and Bengevir's Israel. I do not codemn Palestinians and Israelis. 

I am proud to be aSingaporean BUT I recognise that my country is unbashedly supporting genocide. Sit with this line for a bit. What this means is that, you can feel a certain sense of belonging to your community, and at the same time be able criticise it. If you disagree with -- wont you call this religious fanatism? 

I am keen to hear your perspectives.",-8,0,,2024,3

If the existence of company A benefits Company B somehow which benefits the state of Israel, is A to blame or B? Or both? Should A ditch the dealings? How many levels of loops is acceptable? 

We have enough examples given in this thread on how many components of our lives are 'complicit' so what do we do? 

2. I think why some of us prescribe this as a religious issue is because some lofty individuals have very often determined our moral compass by how loud we seem to be on social platforms. From what I can see, most of the Muslims are comparatively driven about this issue due to the Muslim population in Gaza. Yes there are other religious populations but the majority of them are Muslim. 

Am I wrong if I am not as vocal about it as you are on the issue? We are people of different backgrounds and different life experiences. Say I am a Chinese Taoist taxi driver who has been poor my whole life, my platform would be devoted to protesting about the 9% gst. Am I wrong if I don't connect to the Gazans as much as you? Isn't it the same for the Muslims who have absolutely no regard for the ongoing civil war and daily death tolls in Myanmar? Can I blame the Muslims if they don't connect to the people living there and aren't as vocal as I am? Yes it is a humanitarian issue in Gaza but am I criticised if I am seemingly less committed to the cause since I connect to other issues more?

Statistically, if this was a genocide, it is the lousiest and most inefficient genocide in human history. Seriously, tens of thousands of airstrikes/bombs and ONLY 20k deaths? Keep in mind just 1 bomb can level NTU Hive. 

Knowledge is power. Correct. So use the word ‚Äògenocide‚Äô appropriately. Go and critically think about the death toll vs ordinance drop. If it was a genocide, death toll would easily be over 2 million for the same number of bombs dropped. Refugee camps and hospitals would have been bombed to oblivion. Water would have been cut off permanently. 

Is whats happening a tragedy? Yes. Is it a genocide? No. 

U want to know whats a real modern genocide? Go and google ‚ÄòMariupol‚Äô. Absolute systematic indiscriminate destruction of the entire city. 

2. Then why only on Israel - Hamas conflict? Houthis in Yemen has been over a decade. North Korea on its own civilians has been over half a century. China in Xinjiang has also been a decade. Or Myanmar Junta. Yet you dont see this kind of posters targetting the other parties. Why? Anti-Semites. They are the ones making this a religious issue. 


3. Again, why suddenly target Israel conflict only? Whats so different here compared to Myanmar/Yemen/China/NK? Main common difference is that Israelis are mostly Jewish.

Anyway, lemme summarise my thoughts briefly. Particularly on the religious part.

i think our curriculum teaches us to think of any geopolitical issue from a religious lens as the idea of harmony triumphs all here. Religion might tether Muslims here - but it is not the main reason. It would help us if we understood this nuance. 

secondly, i think I am not attacking you for not having a stance on this. much less, on supporting Israel. I am simply wondering why ppl who have a stance on this are infantilised as religious? Is that the only thing motivating their stance? Humanity doesnt come into play.

I think the classic SGrean mindset of ""it doesnt affect me, why should i care"" is at full speed here. one redditor even has something nasty to say along this lines if u go down a few comments. my view is -- why doesnt humanity come into play as a factor here?

It is a common trope by western supremacists to associate our Muslim brothers and sisters with terrorists. Imagine if ppl associated ordinary Americans with their government.

Unfortunately I've encountered many fellow SGeans that outright support Israel so it's hard not to be on the auto-defence for this kind of thinf. 

I think the reason there is such a strong sentiment is because while it's not the most recent, it has a very major resurgence in recent times and has been an ongoing conflict, and while it may not affect the objectively greatest number of people, when you consider the proportion compared to the Palestine population ‚Äî and particularly horrific statistics like the number of dead children and infants, the number of bloodlines that have ended, the many documented (photo/video evidence, Israeli soldiers proudly talking abt what they've done) heinous war crimes ‚Äî it shows as an especially egregious situation thay desperately needs to be stopped. While other conflicts may not be """"as bad"""", the genocide of Palestine is a very pressing situation because if nothing continues to be done by those in power there is a genuine chance that the gebocide will succeed at the rate of deaths and bombings ‚Äî not to mention the fact that Israel is even bombing other surrounding countries like Lebanon that have nothing to do with it!

To compare with the Russia-Ukraine thing again, Ukraine was still able to receive support from other countries/NATO and able to escape to other countries. Palestinians are trapped within their occupied country and a huge majority of the aid that people are trying to send are being blocked/cut off by Israel. 

Another aspect is definitely social media, since Israel has been trying to silence Palestinian voices online talking about the truth of their situation, many outsiders are using their own platforms to speak out for them where Palestinians cannot. I do admit there is a bit of an issue of people focusing on Palestine alone when there are other huge issues ‚Äî such as what's going on in Congo currently, which is absolutely horrific ‚Äî that also need people's attention, but I guess it's better than nothing, honestly.",6,0,,2024,3

342,Post,1bpodvu,NTUSU alcohol girl/RUOT exposed for playing the victim and being a bully ,WeakDevelopment2493,2024-03-28 06:04:17+00:00,"let's not take the focus away from what R has actually been doing - misusing her platform to bully other people and playing the victim under the guise of social justice. 

this video (https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeRaw/comments/11qa21i/ntu_ejc_ns_peeps_whats_the_tea/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1)  has resurfaced as a result of a post that went up on r/ntu ytd, but the MAIN point is that the 'rumours' she addressed in her video weren't even about her. as somebody from her jc batch, i can attest that a lot of these rumors were about OTHER people, and when she took to the online space to speak about this, a lot of us were genuinely shocked and confused bcos she has never been associated with any of these before. more importantly, her reaction to this video was even more alarming - she went on a doxxing spree of the CHS boys from our batch, called out anybody who said her video was extreme etc. 

R has always had this pattern of twisting and manipulating the truth to fit her agenda. in more recent times, the NTUSU alcohol saga was also blown greatly out of proportion by her - she let the NTU community believe that there was sexual misconduct in the case by lumping together phrases such as ""victims of misconduct/sexual assault"" on her social media, which led to a school wide manhunt for the dude. more importantly, she shared within our own circles (i heard from another one of our batch mates) that she let things go to such an extreme just bcos she hated the guy.

and she's done it once again - on her telegram channel, a place allegedly meant for safe discourse and discussion, she labelled one of her followers a paedophilia by selectively censoring, deleting and silencing any other narrative that didn't fit with her own. the original OP took down the post, but screenshots from her channel can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/13A78UsecLpe357A9i6H7IDw436PoNNNkdzPCeJk35xE/mobilebasic

essentially i think that over the years of knowing R, she has had this repeat habit of manipulating situations and framing the other people for things they didn't do. she's not the saint she paints herself out to be on the online space and as somebody who has interacted with her before and seen people suffer from her actions, i'm quite done also. this girl was our student council vice president in jc, but didn't do much to help out with sch wide events such as orientation. she claims that NTUSU engages in nepotism, but she didn't even run through elections for her previous term (you can see the 32nd election meeting minutes), she was appointed to her old exco role by the previous president. and this year, when she failed her own elections, she went on a rampage about how undemocratic and unfair it was.. kinda ironic  

and when met with criticism, she goes around saying that it's all an orchestrated social media smear campaign. come on la, people have better things to do than fake this kind of thing. it's repeat behaviour, and im glad people are finally speaking up cos this has to stop before another person gets harmed by her selfishness and attention seeking behaviour


edit: stop downvoting sis, you pissed off so many people in JC (and uni too apparently) with your behaviour you should expect that eventually somebody would speak up against you .-.",348,24,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bpodvu/ntusu_alcohol_girlruot_exposed_for_playing_the/,2024,3

Just like how we're ignoring Ethan Ong (well, until he decided to play the litigation card), it would be best to just ignore her actions and move on.

More importantly, NTU's student body still hasn't made demands for a more democratic, accountable, and independent student union.

468,Post,1bk54tk,Misinformation on reddit ,yearningpoet,2024-03-21 12:15:23+00:00,"In the view of recent Reddit posts showcasing a write-up on whiteboard at ADM student lounge and the drama stirred by it, and a few other things I've realised people really like to spread things without ever investigating the context or actually understanding the issue. 

So as posted by one of the reddit users earlier, the full or the"" before erased "" version of the whiteboard writeup, a person, who was NOT from ADM decided to stir up trouble by writing completely defactual and questionable things on the board to which students decided to write a satirical response to it and named it ""Misandrist Manifesto"". When people purposefully try to cause issues , it is obvious that people will retailate in the same font. 

Don't expect people to just deal with bs silently. Somehow, the moment there is a reaction provoked, suddenly the retaliators are the villains. Now the op who posted this doesn't seem to be from Adm , which is weird because these kind of spaces are only for adm students to relax due to that fact we have tons of assignments and projects we have to finish at school and sometimes we need to take some rest and relax a lil bit from work. I cannot confirm who exactly wrote this but no art students be writing things up on whiteboards for no reason, the only reason people wrote it back was because someone else started it first. (Confirmed from students at adm)

Then because the left side was erased somehow it seemed convenient and a perfect opportunity to cause drama and  post the picture  and mock art students and call them jobless and use feminism as an insult against us. Just because we are more open minded and express our views more strongly doesn't mean we are constantly trying to stir up problems with other people. They are hardworking people, who stay up for multiple nights to finish their projects and deal with critiques and stress like every other academically challenging module. We don't have time for all this, let alone writing think pieces on whiteboard for no reason. At most people draw their favorite characters and write cute reminders.

Everyone has the right to express their opinions but to just come here and start berating art students because *checks notes* they are liberal, is not the drag you think it is.

This raises more concerns on misinformation and disinformation spread to defame people. Sure, it's fun to start a drama and get clicks for engagement but remember, the moment you stop verifying things and start blindly believing everything on the internet, is the day you have failed digital literacy 101.

Isn‚Äôt that the best thing to do as a mature adult, rather than taking out a gatling gun to obliterate him with another satire essay, and then leading to an outcome like what we see on reddit, resulting in divides between people for no reason. If you know he is clearly behaving in a non-socially acceptable manner then I think without reciprocating what he did people would‚Äôve understood the situation. 

As for the dude that started it first, wrt what he wrote, the world doesn‚Äôt owe it to him if he can‚Äôt get any dates or women whatsoever, that‚Äôs his own problem. He needs to learn to take failures / falls / no in life.

Being a leftie does not equate to being open minded. Feminism, transgenderism, socialism and communism are considered progressive but progressivism isn't dictated solely by ideology.

In JC you'd have spent majority of your life in a structured education system, with the online world being your portal to all these issues. Very different from gaining your own views throughout your life. Even in uni people are still able to be in a cocoon, insulated from the reality of the world except for a few internships.

And it's not as if you'll be interacting with people in your same age (the way it has been in JC and before) forever.

Right wing left wing who cares. That sort of sweeping generalisation of belonging to a group is exactly what uni is supposed to remove from people's mindsets.",1,0,,2024,3

I have anxiety issues around people and it's been especially bad recently. So I try to avoid being in a crowd as much as possible. That includes the line at the supper truck that forms. I usually ask them to leave the food on the table so that I can get it myself 5 minutes after the truck leaves. They are always very nice to send a picture of proof that they left my food there. 

Maybe you thought that it was a forgotten order, maybe you thought your friend ordered it (that picture had exactly ONE bowl. No one else asked for their food to be left there). Is there not even a grace period of 5-10 minutes? Well, thanks for leaving one of your schoolmates hungry and paying for your selfishness.

ROFL. 

Most delulu statement ive seen this year. 

Just FYI, 2 days during the deadliest part of the Holocaust was already 30K deaths. Even Auschwitz alone had peaks of 15K a day. 

Rwandan 1990s genocide - est 5-8k deaths a day. 1 week death toll already higher than 5 months in Gaza. 

For someone claiming a ‚Äògenocide‚Äô, the death toll is actually miniscule. 

And note, Gaza death toll is already proven to be inflated. So 30k is already the upper bound. Real death toll is likely to be lower. 

So check your facts first instead of parroting some woke crap, thanks.

Again, if there was truly indiscriminate bombing in Gaza, death toll would already be like 3 million there, not 30k, if you really rained down bombs on civilian clustered areas. Im not sure if u understand how powerful conventional explosives are.

Yes. It's not legtimate. It is illegal. Hence why you are referred to as an ignorant. Hospitals have special protections under international law. Go and read up UN resolution 2286. The only time you can attack a hospital is if it is a legtimate military ( not proven). Even if it is (not proven), you must practice proportionality, and the principle of preaution in attack must be applied. Other than asking Gazans to move south as a precaution, they have been indiscriminately bombings hospitals and refugee camps without care, which reflects on the 30K casualties and high amount of children death. You are blind to think otherwise.

Yeah. Say the genius who finds 30K deaths a minor issue, right? There is a difference between surgical strikes and indiscriminate bombings. They should be targeting Hamas Leadership, who planned and conducted 7th October, whether within Gaza and overseas. FYI, surgical strikes do not necessarily mean bombings. It could be through unconventional ways as well. But geez, why would they when it is easier to just bombings the crap out of them.

My stance is 

Violations of int law/committing of localised/isolated war crimes 

=/= 

Genocide

The vast majority of Israel‚Äôs strikes have tried to conform to Int Law as much as possible. Unless there is a overall doctrine/focus of committing war crimes, i dont see it as a genocide. 

Im literally trying to be nuanced here between ‚Äòwar crimes/violation of int law‚Äô vs ‚Äògenocide‚Äô in wartime. However some people can only think dualistically that its either ‚Äòhonorable‚Äô war, or ‚Äògenocide‚Äô. That is the view that im arguing against.

I don't like how universities keep pushing for AI art and generative content in general.

They could actually get real artworks and installations from our department up there but oh well. (I also don't like that there's a generative ai art course. Absolutely terrible?

so context - there's this guy in my wkw batch who i got grouped together with, but i was seriously getting really bad vibes from him? like i would catch him staring at other girls in class, and it was like if you made eye contact with him he would quickly look away (this happened to me a few times before).

but anyways i heard some really sus stuff about him also from people who knew him in JC and hall...  apparently he got reported to his intern place HR before for sexual harassment? my friend knew the girl who reported it and apparently he was always leering at the female interns and doing stuff like standing way too close to them and touching their waist and stuff... 

and also as like somebody who's also aiming to go into the same field (journalism), i get so put off by his lack of journalistic integrity. i've heard from his fellow interns that he would fake his sources just to write an article, or like promise his sources full anonymity then proceed to name drop them .-.

honestly im so disturbed by this and i really don't know what to do :/ i know the sem is ending soon but since we are in the same batch its inevitable that i will still see him around and stuff.. i guess i just wanted to rant cos there's really nothing much that can be done in real life :(

Your assessment is again incorrect.

Yes, there are bad people.. some beyond help. Every society has systems in place to deal with such individuals.. If people are showing traits of being among these hopeless individuals then yes, if society and law allows it, they should be removed from society.. what is important is qualified people needs to do assessment and such evaluation needs to show that they are can't fit in the society norm and next course of actions are to be taken within the setup of law.

you are lying to yourself and leaving out facts. 

You confirm can secure -A- FT job. Right? As you said, it‚Äôs simple. 

But you got standards as a fresh grad, you want a certain type of job and you want a certain salary. Others also want that kind of job and that salary. It‚Äôs competitive, you have already made it to final rounds which is a good sign. 

So, understandably you will take some time to find something befitting your standards because you have the option of continuing to wait around, continue to apply. 

Others who are more desperate and need to pay rent and bills RIGHT NOW would already have jumped to the first FT job that they can find, whether in McDonalds, service staff in restaurants or any random FT admin job in office. You mean all of these are not considered ‚Äúfull-time job‚Äù in real life? 

And we all know those jobs exist. So it‚Äôs not that you ‚ÄúCANNOT secure a FT job‚Äù. 

Be realistic about your own goals and your own expectations and be more patient. Expect high then you need to expect that the journey towards FT job of your standards won‚Äôt be that easy either. 

But don‚Äôt exaggerate that you ‚Äúcannot do something as simple as finding a FT job‚Äù. 

What you mean is, ‚Äúcannot do something as simple as finding a FT job THAT YOU LIKE AND PAYS YOU what you want to be paid‚Äù. 

And in that case, it‚Äôs not that simple anymore. So call it what it is instead of saying you ‚Äúlosing willpower to live‚Äù. 

You see your friends got jobs so you also feel lousy about yourself when you cannot get. If ALL your friends jobless you won‚Äôt feel so lousy right? 

So stop comparing w others cos it‚Äôs incredibly toxic and only harms your mental health. 

Be realistic with yourself and give yourself time and patience. 

The only thing you owe to yourself, is to do your best, keep applying and going to interviews etc. 

That‚Äôs literally ALL that you can do. 

You cannot control companies‚Äô choices. 

Take care of your mental health and your own expectations as well. 

Stop comparing your own journey to your friends‚Äô journeys because that‚Äôs damn toxic and you are all different people. 

I get that it‚Äôs hard and hard on your mental health too. 

Check out the HireClub FB group (free) or do practice interviews with HireClub professionals (paid) if you really want insight on how you interview and how you can improve. NTU has a lot of career resources where you can do practice interviews and resume reviews too. 

But tbh if you can make it to final round, you should be a decent candidate already. So it‚Äôs really a matter of time and opportunities available til you eventually get a position. Be patient and keep applying, great jobs often get filled up fast. Be kind to yourself!",16,0,,2024,3

Ok electricity tariffs, can.

Can we request a breakdown of the operating costs of the halls? How exactly has it changed? Were there new facilities added, staff wage increase? Wouldn't electricity costs go under operating costs?

3 seems like something that can be handled through regulatory changes. If someone moves out after 2 months...offer the room to someone else in the middle of the term then? Better than having it be totally empty. Hard to see the link between this and upping the prices for everyone collectively. While it may force students to consider before applying for hall, I can't help but wonder if there are non-monetary ways to go about it. Like this it also hurts the students who are entirely sure of their need for it to start with.",110,0,,2024,3

He only ansed probably half of the qn I have inside, and told me to not send him codes (when its a coding project). 

Then he forgot/ignored my following email for 5 days till i double emailed him, he replied with follow up questions, which i have already included the anwers to those qn in the pdf i sent him earlier (so either he forgot or he nvr read finish:) ) I tried to ask for a call a few times and he said theres no need to call (when the draft report submission is next wk)  
what do I do....? do i email the undergrad office/the assessor? but idw to affect my final grade for my fyp... i rly put in alot effort in doing this ....  appreciate any advice that yall have in advance :"") crying brb

UPDATE: Thanks for the kind replies and would to clarify that I have been almost entirely on my own for this whole project, and the reason that im trying to speak to him is to make sure that what i have been doing is aligned with the expectations, esp when final report submission is due in a less than a mths time.

Just provide the update. If you need help, ask the internet, ask ai, ask post docs (who has even less incentive to help you, but they may be nicer). Show your work, your ability to be independent.

If you are one of them running the university, what would you do? Do you punish the professor that you know you cannot easily replace? If you made him unhappy, he will just leave and probably move to another university with potentially better conditions for him. You see, the way the system works is never ‚Äò he is a prof so he should supervise students‚Äô. If he is not easily replaceable, then he can do whatever he likes. As for an earlier response using the tuition fee as a point of argument, each professor can easily attract millions of dollars of income for the university in terms of gov grants, industry investment, societal endowment, etc. So tell me what would you do if you are one of the board members running the univeristy?",2,0,,2024,3

got a normal entry-level job for engineering-focused govt agency (not saying which one), paid slightly higher than peers in private sector because engineering pay sucks here. im decent at what i do though.

good work life balance, good govt employee insurance and benefits, above average pay, won't comment on progression since im still < 5 years 

advice for fellow academically weaker students : build your portfolio and at least be good at one aspect of your degree, and bet big on it. gain relevant experience in said niche and you can get a leg up in that area.

I often read about how well-recognized NTU Engineering programs are and its high rankings. MSE, EEE, MAE, etc are all in the world's top 10 for their major. But I'm also privy to how notoriously difficult these programs are and how the workloads and academic units are the highest in NTU.

Is it worth it? I feel like Singapore in general doesn't really appreciate the difficulty of engineering degrees. The effort to get an A grade in engineering classes are kind of ridiculous unless you can soak up everything like a sponge. A FCH score from a humanities/social science degree looks way more impressive than a pass/third degree from engineering.

The engineering industry in Singapore isn't that great, either. Engineering careers in other first-world nations are at least well-rewarded. Here, you put in a crazy amount of effort and get like what? $3-4k? I am also aware that people like to say that with the rigor of an engineering degree, you can ""go anywhere"" or ""do any job"", but how many employers really believe this?

As for me I‚Äôm intending to work in the finance sector, I know vast majority of the people who work in this sector possess a biz / fin / econ major, almost always with a FCH. However, I‚Äôve came across posts on r/FinancialCareers which claim that a technical degree, such as engineering, would not put you at a disadvantage when competing with other biz / fin / econ grads as the working knowledge for banking roles is not dense and can be acquired easily. I‚Äôve also seen LinkedIn profiles of people who fit this claim to further support it. 

Hence the point is, it really boils down to your career trajectory, if it‚Äôs something akin to finance, a technical degree might not compromise your employability at all. In fact you‚Äôll even have greater job security, being able to work both in eng and fin!

1341,Post,1bdmpph,Why are ICC mods causing more stress than my core mods? ,DiverCautious9520,2024-03-13 08:53:03+00:00,"On my last sem of ICC mods currently and while I didn‚Äôt necessarily like all the ICC mods/the people I worked with, previous mods were quite manageable and work could be done well. From all the pre/post course surveys done for ICC, there‚Äôs always a question directing toward how well you are able to work with people from other disciplines, which is one of the purpose of ICC. However, being able to work with people from other disciplines, is based on the assumption that they do work :) super blessed for this ICC mod to be given 4 group mates which don‚Äôt respond to group texts or contribute to group work. The last project proposal was completed alone with one group mate contributing only two days before submission. Emailed my prof regarding the situation and the best that can be done is to monitor them in class. 

Class activities done weekly consists of me starting the docs and writing information relevant to the activity, with some help from the same person that contributed to the group project. The work the other 3 group mates do consist of 1 person blabbing endlessly but writing nothing done, and two people doing the difficult work of adding a content page, changing the Color of the background of the canva poster or searching canva for nice images to use! Sometimes they don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs to be done for the activity even though it‚Äôs posted on the course site and can be read on your own :) it‚Äôs like babysitting three giant babies every week for two hours which is getting exhausting. 

I‚Äôm not a super try hard student, I just want to maintain my grades as they are and ICC mods are super unpredictable on their own already. I‚Äôve had 1-2 bad group mates before but never as a whole group. This is really too much stress from an ICC mod. Would really like to know how I‚Äôm supposed to ‚Äúwork as a group‚Äù to complete this course. Do I just finish all the other projects on my own? You can penalize them in peer evaluation but then you do the work of a group as one person.  Is this fair to any other unlucky student who has to do the same? I don‚Äôt think the school will change ICC to pass/fail so that it doesn‚Äôt affect your grades lol 

Edit: I‚Äôm not someone who lets problems get to them easily, but I‚Äôm ranting about this because having to work with these people on a weekly basis is very exhausting and frustrating, and I cannot describe how obnoxious they are simultaneously.  Also not my first experience with people who don‚Äôt pull their weight, I‚Äôve been quite unlucky with group mates for the last sem or two but this is by far the most ridiculous one. Throughout and after my last class I kept feeling like I couldn‚Äôt breathe and there was a heavy weight on my chest, didn‚Äôt have this feeling before I entered class, only happened after interacting with my wonderful group.

1645,Post,1b6437m,Appreciatin post for ADM SC,yearningpoet,2024-03-04 06:30:49+00:00,"*""Admsc is happy to announce that we have set up emergency pad stations for students to use Incase needed""*

Today I was greeted with this great news, because this is indeed a victory for all those who struggle to find menstrual hygiene products when needed the most at school. 

I've been noticing how our Sc at adm has been very keen in making student life livelier and I believe so much is being done to make things easier for us by SC and the school too! 

Here's some ways our Adm student council has helped us enrich student lives !


- **Adobe Creative Suite License**: After multiple requests and discussions with the school, all of adm finally recieved it's educational adobe license accessible to all students thanks to continued efforts from SC and students alike. This has deeply impacted us in a positive way and as the first batch who recieved this benefit , truly grateful for how it helped make our lives a bit easier by having  Adobe applications on our own devices.

- **Adm Student Lounge** : I've come to know that perhaps we are one of the only schools to offer a lounge space. The lounge is a space for students with fridge and microwave, couches and magazines/books to read to relax and chill in a separate space. Because adm students are notorious for staying at school for long periods of time due to project works, it's cool that we actually have a space to relax and unwind quietly. 

- **Semester events and bazaar** : Truly amazing how despite of how busy work gets , we still manage to have events like Halloween and Valentine's, Start of sem bazaar, welfare day, and other interesting events with amazing performances to cater to a vibrant campus life at adm. Not only does it provide an opportunity to give entrepreneurial students to sell their works but also engages us with activities that can help us take a break from work and assignments.

Thank you Sc! For working endlessly to make events be successful! If you guys are interested, pop by our Halloween event next sem, where there would be music and other cool things to see!


I'm not in the maincomm for SC but I just thought other departments could see and appreciate and perhaps be inspired by the work done by them. Let this be a reminder that students can impact and make lives easier, if the right people are in power! So don't hesitate to raise concerns!

If you take any design classes, you‚Äôll know that the concept known as *perceived affordance* is extremely important. If you make something that does A, you need to shape it somehow that users will look at it and instantly know it does A without the need of any signs. Equally importantly, users should instantly know it‚Äôs not to do B if you don‚Äôt want users to use it to do B.

My personal perception of the object in question aside, it‚Äôs pretty obvious from what actually happened that many people perceived the thing to be a trash bin despite that not being its actual purpose. It indicates that this object‚Äôs designer has horribly failed in terms of perceived affordance. Now they are gonna need to put up signs saying ‚Äúthis is not a trash bin‚Äù ‚Äì this is a workaround at best trying to fix the mistake the designer made.

Now go and look for cylindrical objects that are not trash bins. Do you instantly subconsciously know it‚Äôs not a trash bin? If yes then it is well designed. If you have to engage your conscious self to figure out whether it is a trash bin, then whoever designed that trash bin has utterly failed.",13,0,,2024,4

Its literally a closed cylinder and morons are putting their trash ON TOP of the composter and even just dumping it on the floor instead of INSIDE the composter. No one stopped to think why this trash bin doesn't even have an opening for trash?


Is the lack of a hole not enough to tell people that this doesn't store trash? I know from far it being green and cylindrical makes it look like one but you're not disposing of trash from that distance. You have to physically walk up to it, see no hole, and still think its some funky new bin where you have to put your garbage on the top.",3,0,,2024,4

That‚Äôs the hard part about being a designer: people may behave in really unexpected way and designers are supposed to design for everyone, not just people who share the same perception as the designer.

This is also why user testing is important: if this design, looking good according to the designer, was put to user testing before being actually deployed, it would soon become clear that the prototype needs modifications. The fact that so many people mistook this to be a trash bin tells me user testing was inadequate if carried out at all.",2,0,,2024,4

What I have an issue with is the concept that an admission of guilt, which can be coerced a 100 different ways can equate to actual guilt in social commentary especially when there was no investigations done by an individual unregulated party.

This is especially applicable to the upper echelons of society.

I'm not saying everyone who has ever issued an admission of guilt is innocent. But surely without a doubt in my mind, not all of them are guilty.

It's supported by just one piece of evidence. Written by someone who clearly doesn't have the funds to go against their opponents. There should be a caveat in your argument and social commentary that is sorely lacking.

Sometimes you just need the murder weapon, the body, or the DNA of the culprit. The letter, penned by herself, stating the facts, without any reservations, serves all 3 purposes. She can't repeat these false accusations anymore. If she does, she cannot pretend that she didn't know they were false and were defamatory. Therefore, she cannot repeat these lies without defending them in court.


>understanding of NTU, its SU culture and its orientation culture,


Bold of you to think that commentators here are totally clueless about NTU student government and student leadership. The SU leadership is nothing more than a bunch of glorified CV stackers, who are only too happy to do the administrations saikang for an opportunity to fill up their resumes. The NTU orientation camp culture overall has been rife with problems racism and sexism, and only short of the sexual harassment kind you only see in NUS so far.

275,Post,1c1jouy,"NTU Climbs On QS Subject Rankings, Down On Overall",ResolutionFrosty5128,2024-04-11 16:39:24+00:00,"What are your thoughts? Some highlights:

1. NTU had 10 subjects ranked in the top 10, up from 5 in 2023. NTU had 34 subjects in the top 50 and 45 subjects ranked overall.
2. The ten subjects in the top ten are Chemical engineering, Chemistry, Civil and structural engineering, Communication and media studies, Computer science and information systems, Data science and artificial intelligence, Education, Electrical and electronic engineering, Library and information management, Materials science.
3. In overall ranking NTU slipped from 12th in 2022, to 19th in 2023, to 26th in 2024.
4. The components of the overall ranking that were strongest were International Faculty (100), Academic Reputation (99.4) and Citations Per Faculty (94.4).
5. The weakest rankings were in Employment Outcomes (68.4), Employer Reputation (67.1) and International Research Network (66.1).
6. NTU continues to be the top young university (defined as a university established less than 50 years ago) in the world.

Common discussion points:

1. Research vs Teaching (or student vs faculty): How to better do it? Research is the foundation of the university, you don't want to be studying at a uni which sucks at research. But a university also has to teach. NTU implemented student surveys which make up a big part of prof performance. Should NTU fire a great researcher if he's a disinterested teacher, or hire dedicated teachers who don't do much research?
2. Bad Employment Outcomes: Do you feel NTU doesn't prepare you for interviews and real world job prospects?
3. Coursework: The ICC mods are generally unpopular, students are either OK with them or don't like them. How would you change your curriculum?
4. Young University Syndrome: NTU at 33 years old is, relatively speaking, extremely young. Our age means our alumni network is much smaller, our endowment fund much smaller and less people know about us. Is our youth a handicap, or should we not be resting on our laurels and be even more aggressive in improving?
5. Rankings Are Bad: Rankings are artificial KPIs that should not be what a university is about.

My own 2 cents is that its all about incentive systems and maximising individual choice, instead of top down decision making:

1. Knowledge First: NTU needs to incentivize discovering new and interesting knowledge to the point it should be the sole mission of a university. BUT history has shown that teaching is part of research. 95% of Nobel/Fields/Turing prizes are given to people at orgs that both research and teach (unis), instead of just research. Young students/PhDs ask important, often overlooked questions, and make discoveries of their own in the future. Give resources and positions to intelligent, curious people and let them take it from there.
2. Be Smarter With Teaching: But that being said NTU needs to optimize. We have no undergrad TAs and a handful of grad TAs. This puts massive burden on the professors. You should have TAs answering basic questions about definitions and clearing up basic misunderstandings + software spaced repetition homework for fundamentals. Professor interaction is key to learning and passing down knowledge, but should be used to have higher level discussions which are stimulating to both student and teacher. Profs have more time to research, students get more engagement, undergrad makes money as TAs, everyone is happy.
3. Long term student surveys: Students should really be surveyed some time ***after*** how good a class is. The single metric by which classes should be judged is how impactful what they learnt (or didn't learn) is, whether in research or industry. Instant post-sem surveys can only find basic problems like unresponsive professors.
4. 10%-20% industry guided curriculum: We need more than just old textbook theory. We need top talent from industry not just suggesting, but designing and dictating what we should learn. Not some nonsense about multi disciplinary studies like a whole mod on healthy living. Many vital skills are taught non academic and taught by profs with almost zero exp in it - web dev for example, or backend computer systems. NTU should hire top people in the specific fields either as full time or consultants to build a curriculum.
5. Building and Doing: There's fundamentals you need to learn, but after Y2 onwards students should be building and doing interesting things, either with industry, clubs, profs, startups or open source projects. Whether its intl competitions or personal projects, NTU needs to allocate far more resources, mentorship and attention to these to build both culture and generational knowledge passing. Its crazy that our competitive programming club isn't even formally recognised, its a prof and a handful of students doing their own things while NUS has a whole module on competitive programming. We should minimally have formal clubs for all fields of the international STEM competitions. Employers are waking up to how GPA is a useless metric. Companies want to see and talk about actual projects or achievements, not what grade you got. If you leave uni and try to look for a job with only a piece of paper, you're dead.
6. Young University Syndrome: I've even seen people from NUS saying it is young at 118 years old (by comparing to unis like Oxford). It affects where we are but not the rate of change. Frankly our improvement halted or even worsened under Subresh's tenure. But it's also an opportunity to build a dynamic, aggressive and forward looking org. If NTU descends into bureaucratic, slow thinking, we will just be the same 100 years from now. That said when you grad I want to plug donating to NTU. Not only do you get generous tax benefits (subtract 2.5x donation value from taxable income), but the government will add another 1.5 dollars for every 1 dollar you donate. Larger endowment fund = more returns from investment = more invested in future students and researchers.",145,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1c1jouy/ntu_climbs_on_qs_subject_rankings_down_on_overall/,2024,4

1.Rankings are garbage but NTU is still a good school. NTU‚Äôs engineering curriculum is pretty solid and upto date in comparison to 99% of all universities on the planet. The third and fourth year courses that I took in EEE were in fact really relevant, and very well taught. I may not be able to say the same of the first and second year courses. 

The first and second year teaching might not be great because of the insanely huge class sizes. I don‚Äôt disagree with the fact that we need more TAs. 

2. This has more to do with the economy more than the school itself. In any other normal year you generally see high employment rates and decent salaries. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre expecting the school to give you? There more than 10k undergrads and it‚Äôs impossible for the school to give everyone individual attention. You have the career resources, and you are responsible to make the best use of them. 

3. I can‚Äôt speak for this never took the ICC curriculum. But it‚Äôs more so with top ranked schools obsession to give undergrads a liberal arts education. I don‚Äôt know how well NTU is doing it.

4. This literally has to do with nothing for an undergrad. You‚Äôre not going to reach out to your alumni who graduated more than 50 years ago right? NTU has a great alumni network among recent grads.

And also to add on, among many of the other top ranked schools NTU charges a modest tuition fee, and has a lower endowment. I‚Äôd say we are getting a good deal for our buck 8k for Singaporeans and 16k for PR and foreigners with tuition grant per year.

But they are useful for attracting talent. Also lining to your point 4, alumni networks and networks in general provide key information feedback. NTU EE is very strong, but the up to date, modern curriculum comes from either profs doing cutting edge research or industry feedback orienting NTU in that research direction. In some places which are very industry important but lacks research, like web dev, this can be a big issue.
2) I'd say there's definitely room for improvement. This also has to do with feedback and alumni. Industries are becoming increasingly specific and with specific knowledge needed to get past gatekeeping. For example a very strong culture and industry feedback for pitching is essential in IB jobs. Alumni play a huge invisible role in flowing that information back into the university. NTU should do more to recognize and grow these areas, particularly alumni engagement. Imma put my money where my mouth is and hope to engage with NTU even after I grad.¬†
3) ICC isn't even liberal arts. It was a bizzare attempt by Subresh to chase the buzzword of interdisciplinary learning. We ended up taking a useless mix of a health living course, a marketing course and a joke of a computational thinking course.¬†
4) This puts us in both a good and bad position. More affordable means we can attract more top talent. But what I strongly don't like is NTU still basically looks at pure grades (from what I hear). It is extremely outdated and no high performing university does this.¬†",8,0,,2024,4

I would not personally expect a CS degree to teach me about technology such as web dev/ mobile dev that are rapidly changing. Frameworks for these are highly varied based on the organisation's requirement. A CS degree adequately prepares you for entry level roles for all kind of SWE/ DS/ ML roles. There is a big difference between attending a bootcamp to learn javascript, and doing a CS degree. I find hiring consultants from industry like bootcamps to do undergraduate education bizarre.
2. I would doubt that NTU does not engage its alumni for feedback sharing about industry and job market. I reached out to many of NTU alumni during my internship / grad school search, most were responsive and helpful.

The difficultly is that while NTU does do a good job, it is an incredibly competitive, winner takes all industry. For practical purposes you are at a huge disadvantage if you don't because web dev/such technologies, but at the same time it changes very fast. And there are many of these. So a university which can keep up with the times while teaching in a curriculum that makes it transferable to different frameworks/technologies will give its students a huge advantage. I am absolutely against hiring any bootcamp teachers, but in the same way that an EE student would be at a huge disadvantage if he didn't know how to build a circuit, CS/SCSE students are at a huge disadvantage if they don't know certain things. I am for getting very experienced people to help students execute with projects, which is what companies look for. I am all for supercharging programs like competitive robotics the college of engineering has. This not only raises the prestige of the school, builds invaluable institutional knowhow and makes learning more fun, it also raises the skills and employability of our students.
2. I have reached out to alumni as well and they are very helpful, my intention was that the school administration does it poorly. I have heard similar things from SoH people that what feedback/knowledge that comes to students is usually informal. In SCSE much less is done by the admin (but the students do a lot) to learn and acquire certain core skills like algo/ds coding.
3. ""Holistic admissions"" are nonsense but there are very practical reasons to admit people with non-exam talents and interests - intellectual deviants/extremely curious people are more likely to make discoveries and do interesting things. For example, Nobel prize winners are [5 to 22 times more likely than baseline scientists](https://biomedicalodyssey.blogs.hopkinsmedicine.org/2024/01/beyond-the-renaissance-nobel-laureates-and-their-creative-pursuits/#:~:text=Nobel%20Prize%20recipients%20were%20nearly,plays%2C%20poetry%20or%20short%20stories) to engage in art, singing, woodworking, mechanics etc. Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, etc all read constantly and non-stop. Young entrepreneurial people - like Zuckerberg who founded a company before he went to college - are much more likely to do interesting things. Anecdotally I know a handful of PhDs from top universities in the world and they all engage extensively in interesting hobbies.

On the flip side, extremely difficult, steep bell curve, high stakes exams like JEE/A-Levels/gaokao are extremely poor metrics beyond a moderate cutoff. The top performers here are not stupid, but you will not get passionate, curious and innovative people by just looking at exam scores. American and British standardised exams/high school are much easier and just set a baseline.

The fairness part is legitimate, but exams are not fair (rich people can pay for tuition) and it is foolish to try to be fair only at the final stage of your education when you're entering college. I am also strongly in favor of NTU setting up programs/competitions/math circles open to everyone which can get children of all backgrounds a rich environment to develop themselves.",2,0,,2024,4
289,Comment,1c1jouy,"NTU Climbs On QS Subject Rankings, Down On Overall",Professional-Ad6994,2024-04-12 17:38:32+00:00,"1. I think you are overcomplicating the process of being hired for SWE roles. Just do your leetcode, learn a tech stack or two and do some cool projects. The SWE economy Is really bad right now and there are too many folks competing for jobs at the entry level, NTU choosing to train undergrads in web dev won't fix the job market. The basic concepts such as OOPS, DSA etc.. are generally important, and will help you pick up all the frameworks and libraries you need to learn easily. The work that you would do as a SWE also has very little to do with the generic web programming you learn on YouTube and bootcamps. 

More importantly the prestige of your university usually plays little to no impact in hiring in the IT industry.

2. You have multiple courses in algorithms, and sufficient career services to reach out to. 

3. IMO this is a correlation-causation fallacy. Hobbies should be done out of pure interests. The school should not force you to take up CCAS to add resume points. Interesting people just do interesting things. It has nothing to do with what university they attended or what was the admission process of that university. 

  
Well, you cannot get into any Ivy League school without being at the top of your class academically. Grades are a very important factor in all schools and it is not going to go away. Adding CCAs as an additional layer in the process just makes things so much worse. Nobody should be forced to do CCAs just to pad up their resume.",2,0,,2024,4
290,Comment,1c1jouy,"NTU Climbs On QS Subject Rankings, Down On Overall",ResolutionFrosty5128,2024-04-12 18:23:54+00:00,"NTU, its students especially, have done a great job. For example our teams do pretty well at ICPC, we won first and the regionals a few times these past years. But I absolutely disagree with resting on our laurels. Students *can* (and often do) do a lot of things. The question we should be asking isn't if they can get a job (they can), or if the market is bad (it is), its how can NTU can aggressively improve, make them better at their jobs and open more doors.

NTU doesn't do as well as it can on the basics like OOP and DSA because we don't have the focus or institutional buildup. What we have is some prof who's brilliant at machine learning or something but has no experience with even moderately sized OOP projects. Often he's cycled out after a handful of years. Compared to say NUS, where they have dedicated profs/mentors who have been coaching students in competitive programming for more than a decade. This huge skills misalignment is a problem. There is absolutely is an opportunity cost. Fresh JC/poly grads have very little idea how anything works. Yes they can learn it themselves, but they both learn it late and have to do it while doing other courses, esp nonsense ones like ICC. And I do agree it is nothing like generic bootcamps. Which is why NTU should get top talent in the fields to teach in a systematic way the best in the business. I'm not saying you have a whole specialisation on it, but one or two mods early on with projects would give them a huge leg up. And I see no reason why with some effort you use student effort to contribute to, say, research projects that need some devs, or the schools IT services. 

Might be some misunderstanding, I am talking about 2 different things about comps/clubs vs admissions. The first NTU should strongly support for the reasons I gave above (invaluable skills, building things, expanding student creativity, knowhow). As it is most comps are just students doing it on their own initiative, anything that is learnt is forgot because its not fed back into the institution. So that flywheel effect of each successive batch getting better never starts. NTU needs to set up that foundation to keep, retain and improve knowledge. NTU shouldn't (and can't) really force students to, but there is no end of NTU students who will do and apply themselves to these things.   


The second I'm not saying NTU force students to do those things because I think it makes them smarter or something, I'm saying the opposite. NTU should strongly weigh interesting/creative passions in applicants. In itself that should be goal. Top Ivy schools don't take in someone because they do really really well on some super high bell curve exams. They take in ""T-shaped"" students. Students who broadly do very well in simple baseline academics (which in the US is quite easy to get almost perfect on SATs/ACTs) and very, very well in a specific thing. Whether its they do really well in competitive math/programming, or won robotics competitions, or play incredible jazz, or have a great maker portfolio etc. These are the kinds of applicants NTU should chase after.",1,0,,2024,4

I usually stay up till 2AM (now 4AM during exams), and he usually goes to sleep around the time that I wake up that is 8AM.   
He often talks loudly on the phone and is ON SPEAKER PHONE. Plays games and naturally shouts whole playing.  
I have been tolerating much of the disturbance for most of the past semester. But during exams it's irritating af because I cannot afford to be operating at 60% capacity rn.  
I feel like he should be able to do whatever he wants in the room cause it's his too. But because of him I'm not able to do what I want in the room.  
Forgive me if I'm being irrational. I grew up sharing a room with my brother, and if one of us was studying/sleeping the other had to either shut up or leave the room. Ig uni room sharing requires a lot more adjusting.

Will your roommate listen? Given that he is the type to do these things in the first place (cb behaviour), probably not. You can still try, but if I were you, I'd ask in writing (Telegram) first, bringing up his actions. That way, if he refuses to change his behaviour, you might be able to get hall office to blacklist him from double rooms. Doesn't help you but helps his future hallmates.

But have a Plan B, i.e., go back home or 24/7 cafe like JP CBTL to study.",99,0,,2024,4

This is just utter disrespectful behavior. Everyone knows it's the exams week and they see you studying and still cant shut up. Like bruh are you deaf and blind? Anyway, the only thing you can do is find somewhere else quiet. I believe there are other places in NTU where you can use. You'll never be able to focus studying if you're just tolerating this behavior. They won't also like it when you tell them, and will be so much entitled when they answer you, saying they are also paying for the room too. This might also cause some conflict, because these type of people have this mindset of ""why do I have to adjust to you, I'm paying for this room too"" --- that's why they are doing what they are doing.

If he does not listen, every time he makes noise, I want you to whip out your cock from your pants and start furiously jacking off. Look him dead in the eyes and then let your eyeballs roll back into the back of your head as you masturbate aggressively. 

To prove your dominance, you may also choose to ejaculate in his direction and moan as you do so.

This is called conditioning. It will cause him to associate him making noises with his roommate jerking off furiously and getting cream his way, which will cause him to feel uncomfortable. This should likely reduce the occurrences of him making such noises in the future

The alternate is taking a stick and beating him in the ass. That also works but it is less üÜí",7,0,,2024,4

1. Don‚Äôt put up any expectations as a friend
2. Understand that if the attached girl ever starts chasing you in a friendship, you are her second choice. And she will definitely have a third choice after hanging out with you.
3. Female and male platonic friendship can only truly sustain when one party is significantly more unattractive than the others and understand any progress is pointless.
4. Never ever text late at night to your opposite gender friend. 

That‚Äôs all the cue I can give to sustain it for as long as I have experienced, all the best to your friendship.",3,0,,2024,4

IIRC when I did the hall application as a freshie, there was no page that asked us to choose which hall we wanted, only what type of room in order of preference. 

For senior hall application (12-22 April), there is a page where you can indicate your top 2 preferred halls, and room selection application for your top preferred hall.

If you want to be sorted into a specific hall, your best chances are to find a senior (the more reputable the better) within that hall to rec you into the hall once freshman rec lists are released. Senior rec lists have already closed (2-19 April).

He tried to socially ostracize me from my clique. I had a bad feeling from the day I met him because he felt just like this other guy in sec 2 who would threaten to murder others just for conceding a goal in a soccer match. 

That guy was like a tribal chief. And ‚Äútribal chiefs‚Äù have always made my life miserable. 

You know whats the worst part? That one encounter at the bus stop, years after jc, i thought i was free from him. I fell back into my state of fear and anxiety. 

My sister is likely to matriculate in ntu this year and im so scared if she brings back that guy as a partner, I would just pack up my things and leave becuase of the social trauma he inflicted on me.

Some other stalls, e.g. Japanese stall accept the discount too, BUT ONLY if you use the NTU card for payment (another trick they use to avoid giving customer discount because most people use debit/credit card for payment).

but in any case, the main point is this: by saying ‚Äúi‚Äôll drop all police investigations‚Äù, it suggests that a police report has been made. when a police report has been made, even if the victim does request for cessation of police investigation or dropping of charges, it‚Äôs not up to the victim to decide. when a criminal wrong is alleged, it is a wrong committed not only against the victim, but also against the state. the police may choose to investigate if they suspect a crime has been committed, and thereafter make recommendations to AGC. AGC will then review the case, and choose to press charges or drop the case - they have discretion over the matter (Art 35(8) of Constitution). victim more or less has no say in the proceedings after the report has been made. 

if anything, this appears to be a scare tactic. but then again, i‚Äôm just a ppga dropout scrolling reddit at 0300hrs and seeing the familiar 4 letters of my course again just got me fully awake, and should not be taken seriously. i will not flatter myself (i think ppga students will get the reference).",119,0,,2024,4

642,Post,1bszzlm,"NTUSU exco astroturfing, doxxing, death threats? (comparing info from google docs guy, deleted threads, and mods)",depetir,2024-04-01 10:18:59+00:00,"**TLDR** : Two things can be right at once. I was inclined to believe the google docs guy was in the right, in which case ruot should apologise, but his avoidance at specific points is not inspiring any confidence. NTUSU people riding on this to push their unrelated agenda of winning over public opinion of ethan, even before the court hearing results are out, using numerous fake accounts, are definitely in the wrong. Even when or if the google docs guy is right, this behaviour (death threats, doxxing) does not do either him nor ruot justice. This behaviour is very unbecoming of SU leaders especially when they are supposed to be holding an important position and should be held to a higher standard.

NTUSU exco seems to be so free these days. Can you tell us what's actually going on now instead of hiding behind day-old accounts claiming to be a [comm member](https://www.reddit.com/u/BookkeeperOk5641/s/gSpsGclbkC) and [WSC member claiming to have some emails of her](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1brbnck/comment/kxcznnj/?share_id=rx-yXTS17XIwzUuYhtqxK&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) and [someone who's so eager to absolve the ong lai of responsiblity](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bpym58/comment/kx2qpzp/?share_id=3arFd4MZGuOKsllj_Tcci&utm_content=2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) and an [SSS student](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/Wd3SqK2jLO) and even one [claiming that she deserved it because of what she wear and it is normal to get your friends drunk without their consent](https://undelete.pullpush.io/r/NTU/comments/1bps2bd/removed_by_reddit/)?

**All of these comments are from accounts that are newly created!**

Can we actually wait until the court results come out instead of making so many new accounts to, presumably, manipulate public opinion? Big difference between using already-existing anonymous accounts and making a lot more to make your own opinion look like the majority.

And why need to post the same thing from [so](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/2bq7KVmXVZ) [many](https://www.reddit.com/user/Heavy-Address-2135/) [different](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bpym58/ruots_online_behaviour/) accounts? **Pretty obvious that same guy owns multiple accounts here.**

As for the guy who wrote the google doc, he messaged me after I made [the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bpwpjr/how_is_this_a_real_channel/) pointing out that there were fake accounts and asked for clearer screenshots. He messaged me all the screenshots saying ""come I have nothing to hide"" and then, while I was reading through them, deleted them all and said ""why so quiet? Come ask away"" and then sent the screenshots again. Fine, I continued reading.

At this point I was thinking maybe he was right. Asked him got any screenshots of the group chat before that conversation so I know it isn't another fake channel. He sends none.

I then asked him if he had screenshots of ruot posting his name, because she posted his name front and center right? He had none. Apparently she didn't even post his name there.

Then he said after that her friends came to message him through finding his username on the channel. I asked him for screenshots of what they said to him? Did they say a lot of nasty stuff? Then he didn't send any.

Because he mentioned that NTUSU messaged him, I asked what it that conversation is about, and he just up and deleted every single message. You know screenshots exist right? You said you had nothing to hide right? Dude just said said never mind ""I don't need you to believe me"". Look, **I wanted to believe him but this behaviour of...avoiding/not being able to send anything beyond what is posted is not helping his case.**

For those potentially saying these screenshots are out of context, the conversation is relatively long and you are free to DM me for the full conversation with the names censored.

**Honorable mentions:**

[Guy who called her a slut and then said she too ugly to be slutshamed and then said she victimises herself for posting the video of exactly what they said](https://www.reddit.com/user/InformalPsychology11/)

Person who [was among those who promoted the AI girl which is an SU initiative](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/lY8ZTEgRjb] is also one of the people who's been making repeated posts of ruot, despite seeming like they hated SU for a few posts. 

[Person here seems like they asked her to k*ll herself and refused to delete it until she apologise to NTUSU](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bps2bd/comment/kwxteaf/) which I feel is very unbecoming of NTUSU leaders. They're not even trying to hide who they are now? Also, mods have confirmed that [there were a lot more death threats towards her than Ethan that they had to delete](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1bsufds/comment/kxi8fwz/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). I don't even remember seeing random anons do it, but **SU leaders especially should not be doing this!**

One other bit of information, but the google docs guy is interning at the same place as ethan is. Tinfoil hat moment or not, I will let yall decide...

Lastly, let me remind you all again of SU's [history](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/Jd5UyCxPWV) of [astroturfing](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/ONnyqoIrcP) and [outright lying about their own achievements](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/mUzxlz12oh) and [using a fake throwaway account to make up excuses of ""not having a platform therefore NTUSU must stay silent""](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/2ZRvp07GeQ) since 2021 or maybe even earlier. NTUSU does not exactly have a clean track record. 

Again, I must re-emphasise that I do not know any of them in real life. I will not support the behaviour from ruot if it were real, but the main problem is with the NTUSU people who have absolutely no link to this incident. They are going too far and are just using this incident to give eaten more credit, all while doxxing and sending death threats using multiple burner accounts.",76,32,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bszzlm,2024,4

Truth is, based on an actual encounter, is that they will do a surprise spot check, give warning if caught first time and tell them not to continue doing so. They may spot check again after and then if caught AGAIN then maybe action will be taken lor. 

This is because when you report, they have to do SOMETHING to follow up what.

i tore 9 squares of toilet paper, fold until become 1 square, but the toilet paper literally broke down the middle as i wiped

pls la if they already increased hall fees by such a large %, now they downgrade the basic stuff, even mrt/hawker centre/park connector toilet paper better

as someone who shits alot (or is full of shit) this is unacceptable.

if you say bidet >> toilet paper not wrong, but i dont like having wet underwear every time i shit, anyway most of the toilets dont even have bidet lol

side note all 4 toilet bowls in my toilet the seat is loose, can literally be brought out of the toilet - reported to onestop/hall office, they just closed it as ""fixed"" with no comments whatsoever

probably should have pursued it further but i cba at this point

in fact they seem to have become better friends, in my absence, and while i was suffering. And i really dont know what to do other than to just get used to it and try to push through but some days it just gets very hard to do so. it really hurts to see that the people that i cared about, really dont seem to give any thoughts for me and would rather just spend their time within themselves. its like my company was just out of convenience or smth.

884,Post,1c58cui,"Peer Evaluation ""Mechanism""",DiverCautious9520,2024-04-16 05:33:37+00:00,"Wanted to share something fun I found out about the **fairness of peer evaluation for ICC** :)

I previously posted a thread about how I got stuck with a group of people who don't do anything for group work and had to complete all the assignments on my own. We're nearing the end of the semester and I had to communicate with my professor because one of them took the work that I spent three days on and did an alternate version with my content. On one hand, I'm pissed that a good portion of my work was just scrapped like this, but on the other I also acknowledge there are some merits to what the other person has done. The issue is that this second version does not align with certain requirements of the assignment.

I got stuck on how to proceed from here because I can't force my choice on the group so I decided to consult my professor. Throughout the call, something my professor kept repeating was ""the mechanism"" and I didn't process what it meant. Took me a minute but I realized what he was saying is that **based on the peer evaluation system**, whether or not **I did most of the assignments on my own**, **everyone will be accredited** for it. On the other hand, **if my group harbors any grievances against me and decides to mark me down, I will not be fully accredited for the work that I did, while they still are.** *EDIT: this ""mark down"" scenario is hypothetical before someone else comes and says that I need to look in the mirror, I'm mainly annoyed that people are getting credit without doing work, I'm righteously pissed after doing the work of a group on my own*

The only reassuring thing my professor could do was tell me that he will do his best to protect me in this scenario. I understand that this isn't his fault in any way because it is how the system is and it's not something he has a say over. At the same time, this is the most f'ed up thing that I've had to deal with in all my schooling years. We're all paying for our education, and somehow I've paid for a semester where an ICC mod has taken up more headspace and mental capacity than my core. Money well spent.

tl;dr peer evaluation exists to provide a false illusion of fairness, you can be the only one doing the work and not be credited, so **play nice with your group mates because the work doesn't matter that much anyway**",63,27,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1c58cui/peer_evaluation_mechanism/,2024,4

So what I do usually is to make sure everything is well documented, google docs will be strictly accessed by users rather than anonymous users (also to look out for freeloaders).

I also use telegram to delegate tasks and screen record occasionally to prevent other users from deleting msgs then claim otherwise, and I also private message slackers and take note of the timestamps.

I do all these is to protect myself against snakes or someone with questionable morals, but so far I'm glad nothing happened, it's just a precaution.

I also understand that you may feel unfair and helpless, because I felt the same. I worked hours for someone who did not even contribute anything and for him to share an A for the presentation and the worst part is he was ungrateful. Awful. 

However, we cannot mark him down because we used chatgpt, in no way we want to be investigated and get caught using AI. As such, we left it as it is. I didn't use chatgpt but my group mates did.

So I wouldn‚Äôt say I did most of the work but everyone did their part equally and I did complete all the work I need to do and also helped out others too. I also did ask for feedbacks on my work periodically from my team leader and other team mates cuz this courses is mainly group project and peer evaluation acts as a moderation factor so it is very crucial. When the results came out I got 2 grades lower than my team mates, I asked the prof he said is due to peer evaluation. He concluded with ‚Äòyou deserved better teammates‚Äô. And he told me he couldn‚Äôt enclosed the feedbacks done on me cuz it is very ‚Äòpersonalised‚Äô and will direct to the person who did the peer review on me which is a situation he wouldn‚Äôt want to see. He proceeded to ask me to ‚Äòaccept and move on‚Äô and that grades are not the most important thing in life and that sometimes you just need to get used of being betrayed in life and that he had similar experiences before. He proceeded to say that he knows that I have done good and he was shocked that I got marked down too but he thinks the system is fair.
I talked to another professor of the course too because I truly think it‚Äôs unfair that I did my part and there were no any feedbacks given to me throughout the project. The prof told me doing ur part is not enough, you need to do above and beyond, and if you couldn‚Äôt complete the part with perfection, shouldn‚Äôt have volunteered to do it, maybe considering outsourcing etc. 
Truly a traumatising experience, makes me understand when unfairness happen there is nothing NTU will do to protect victims of peer review. I know so much people in the course who marked down people that had arguments with them or they just didn‚Äôt like. And the prof knowing that it is suspicious still decided to take in the factor of peer review and affect the grades so heavily. 
So I guess getting the parts done are not the most important thing in group projects with peer review, being diplomatic and have very close friendships with ur teammates are more important.

My social life is dead, I have no time for interests aside from school and I‚Äôm constantly tired from getting to and around school. I‚Äôve maintained a really healthy Gpa (4+) for years. But I can‚Äôt care anymore. Idk if its burnout but I just feel like what they‚Äôre doing to us is abnormal. 

The kicker is, we do on average 6 modules per semester when every other country‚Äôs uni‚Äôs do 3. WHAT? They do 3 which gives them enough time to actually be a well-rounded person and do things like networking which is actually valuable in the real world. 

Sorry but I have a friend that did the 1.5 year ‚Äòcorner-cutting degree‚Äô at sim and he has an amazing job and is earring near 10k now because he‚Äôs got 3 years of experience ahead of me. 

There is for real no need for us to know that much, especially humanities degrees. I got my first c this Semester because I just can‚Äôt try anymore. I‚Äôm just too tired and instead of feeling depressed I feel free.

 Like actually yeah all that matters is I graduate - passing the degree is literally enough to kickstart your career. The rest is all you. Well that‚Äôs my opinion anyways. I‚Äôm just over judging myself in a system that‚Äôs designed to push to me past normal human limits and forces me to sacrifice everything else that gives my life meaning. 

I‚Äôm not telling anyone to intentionally perform badly. But placing my attention on things that make me feel like a person besides sch has truly been the most enjoyable time I‚Äôve had here.

Some fields can be so competitive that not only you need extremely high GPA. They even requires you to have internship experiences, and winning some hackathon / competitions.

GPA definitely does not measure how well you can work in the real world, but it is one of the few gauge your employer have especially for first job.

My advice is that, if you need a break, take on gap sem or extend your bachelor period to 4.5 or 5 years. This way, it will be easier to balance both results and life. There's nothing to be ashamed about. 

Regarding your comparison with your friend earning 10k or whatever, I think there's little context for me to make judgement. I have friends who own businesses without even doing universities. Comparison is endless and there's too many factors involved. Focus on what you want in life and work towards that. 

Good luck.",18,0,,2024,5

There are only so many things that you can pursue in life at once. If you want to pursue passion? You might have to give up money. Cuz i‚Äôm pretty sure your friend from SIM did not majored in humanities and neither is he in the humanities field right. 

Your fourth paragraph says that you suddenly realised you are no longer interested in studying humanities, as you do not see a link between the knowledge and adult / working life later on, which is true for the most part probably, unless you become a teacher. 

Hence I think it is important for you to realise and accept the fact that you made a mistake in your earlier years, and move on with your life and take measures to correct that, rather than blaming everything around you, even the system. 

Personally I do not regret choosing to major in engineering at NTU even after 4 years.",10,0,,2024,5

So do they pay more rent or what? What gives these people the entitlement to these seats that they are not paying for. Is it fair for students who bother to wake up at 8am to come to the study room just to realise that they can't even find a seat at the earliest timing because these people decides that the whole reading room is theirs? Some of them even have the audacity to come at 3pm in the afternoon where the seats could have been better utilised by their fellow hall mates for the entirety of that 8 hours. ,203,27,https://i.redd.it/64hq9v9vycyc1.png,2024,5

I'm in Psychology and my $800 Lenovo laptop from 2021 (which I bought just before entering year 1 in 2021) is still more than capable enough for my work. If an $800 2021 laptop is able to serve me until now, then there is no reason why an $800 2024 laptop wouldn't be able to do the same for you. 

In fact, I have switched fully to a tablet, the Xiaomi Pad 6, for all my schoolwork, and you can easily find the same tablet for less than $400 online from official Xiaomi retailers. I now have easy access to a touchscreen for note reading and studying while on the go (very very useful for reading on the train, I cannot stress this enough), and high quality bluetooth keyboards + mice are also extremely easy to find for below $20 when typing is necessary. You can also opt to shill for the official smart keyboard (which attaches via a 3 pin connection instead of using bluetooth) and the official smart pen, but they are unecessary imo. 

If the laptop you are buying is going to be your only computer (e.g. no desktop at home), then spending more on a higher end model would make sense. If you have a powerful desktop at home like me, there's really no point spending more than 1k on a laptop when your major's most pc intensive task is simply document reading.",3,0,,2024,5

For especially science and biz/socials guys at least you mainly should look for higher clock rates (less parallel capability) of CPU and RAM - too many algorithms in maths/physics can be parallelized to only some extent; buying a powerful GPU seems like a waste of money in this case... GPU and gaming laptops are generally a tradeoff for weight and battery life as others mentioned as well as price increase; you don't really need a GPU unless you do rendering or gaming (which you don't in science/biz/socials mainly)... mine 4yo (back then) 800$ laptop works just fine as of now, and really you don't need anything super expensive and powerful (maybe except CS)",2,0,,2024,5

1. Battery life is extremely bad especially after one year. From 3 hours on new purchase to 1 hour after a year. To zero after 2 years. Expected of a gaming laptop due to the heat generated by the graphics card. The battery can‚Äôt cool down so it degenerates faster. But the sad part was it bloated and the keyboard looked like a little hill. The lid couldn‚Äôt be closed fully. It probably damaged some other component (see below). Replacement quoted at SGD300. 
2. It is big and heavy. The power brick is at least 600g or almost half the weight of a Mac book Air. So consider this if you‚Äôre lugging it around which is always. I think this laptop was built for desktop use. 
3. Something died and so the screen now flickers constantly. This was after 2 years. Warranty ended. Replacement was quoted at SGD800. I didn‚Äôt know what else might break, so I didn‚Äôt replace it and instead attached it to a monitor. So, the laptop became a permanent desktop. 
4. It gets hot when running. So, your lap is not a place for it. 
5. The GPU did its job for my games eg Flight Sims, Counter Strike and video editing. 
6. Its real estate is big! Not good for lecture tables or those tables attached to chairs. The laptop will be flat on the table as the ‚Äòlegs‚Äô are too wide. And your friends won‚Äôt be happy sitting and studying with you because you use so much space.",2,0,,2024,8

My personal recommendation is Macbooks for the portability and battery life. If you can't find a workaround with software compatibility issues, boy do I have news for you as a CS grad.

1. Prof Ho aims to make NTU the best technological university in Asia and recruit a future Nobel prize winner. His dream is for a truly game changing discovery to be made at NTU. He believes young people's energy, attitude and ambition is key to this, instead of seniority or experience.
2. NTU has raised the number of assistant professor hires (the least senior grade of professor) from 7 to 20 a year. 80% of new hires are early career researchers.
3. In global fight for talent, he uses his experience in behavioral economics to get edge in recruitment against wealthy schools like MIT. Beyond accommodations and salaries, includes hiring recruitment consultants to find jobs for professor's spouses, paying for flight tickets for family travel and having cutting edge lab equipment.
4. NTU likes to hire new profs based on research partners' recommendations.
5. He believes NTU's youth (at 33 years) is a key advantage and gives it a startup mentality. Compared to Berkeley (where he worked for 12 years) which has old established ""kingdoms"", NTU adapts and moves faster.
6. He was born in a taxi.

Some historical background:

1. Similar to Prof Andersson (the one before Suresh), he is putting youth/new technologies at the focus.
2. Cross referencing with an interview he gave to Korean newspaper [The Chosun Daily](https://www.chosun.com/english/people-en/2024/02/07/MNQGQ3B2UBE3TAXH7UZSZGKBKA/) where he also mentioned MIT's wealth, he's acutely aware one of NTU's big weaknesses is financial firepower. He aims to reduce reliance on external/gov funding from 85% to 60%, while increasing donations from $20 million to $100 million, with additional $250 million in matching grants.
3. Also from the Korean interview he is focused on recruiting top talent, including postdocs. Value driven researchers are the priority.",144,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1cy2i97/ntu_president_plans_to_recruit_future_nobelists/,2024,5

1. Quite impressed by how he's putting an emphasis on youth and energy. Much better than gov/civil service servant mindset where helicopter the oldest scholar they have into top roles, then he hires all his kakis.
2. Tracks with what I'm seeing in SCSE/CCDS. A lot of new young profs are coming in who are very young/fresh PhDs like Prof Ustigov and Watt. Notice they like to let them to a presentation which they will email the whole school for to sort of vet them.
3. Mentions some buzzwords like AI and personalised learning (these are far from practical and deployable), but has made tangible changes in the recruiting pipeline, finance. Much better than Suresh, who doesn't even seem to understand NTU's position (in terms of age, financial resources, reputation, etc) and just ran it like some department. New pres seems to want to take advantage of NTU's youth while recognizing key challenges like financial resources.",67,0,,2024,5
193,Comment,1cy2i97,"NTU President Plans To Recruit Future Nobelists, Sees NTU As A Startup",HW90,2024-05-22 23:56:45+00:00,"I think there is still a lot to do to achieve those goals. 

The bureaucracy for staff at NTU is incredibly stifling for recruiting talent and is very against a ""startup mentality"". It regularly takes 6 months to hire in postdocs, meanwhile we're losing good PhDs because of the GRE score requirement at a time when US universities are phasing them out. At Assistant Prof level, recruitment is overly quantitative and values a large number of low quality outputs over the small number of high quality outputs which put universities into Nobel prize recognition. This mentality frankly drips down to undergrads as well, quantity of work over quality of work, so as soon as they move to PhD level they're often not doing the kind of work which is internationally competitive. You're bound to get talented people who can do everything, but they're a minority and in academia it's better to focus on the people who can do a small number of things exceptionally.

Salaries are good but not good enough to warrant the work life balance and slow career progression, plus for foreigners the immigration benefits. If you've got a choice between Imperial and NTU, then you're probably going to choose the one where you work half the hours, you're basically guaranteed to make associate prof in 2-3 years, and your spouse can get a job without qualifying for a visa in their own right, plus guaranteed PR and citizenship in 3-4 years, in exchange for that slight drop in salary.

If NTU wants to embrace young talent, a startup mentality, and Nobel prize potential then it basically needs to raze the culture down and build it back up from scratch.",14,0,,2024,5

We are about to see a major change to NTU.

To be honest even that isn't universal, a lot of work done for some postdoc positions could be equally done by a Senior Research Engineer/Scientist.

It would be easier to set criteria if postdocs were required to be given a categorisation based on the kind of work they're required to do and whether it's conducive to an academic career. E.g. have ""academic route"" postdocs where the work is conducive to the postdoc meeting the criteria to be hired as an assistant prof, like highly focused on publishing papers but also good experience on teaching and grant writing. Then you could have researcher route where there is less focus on teaching and grant writing. Then industry oriented where it's more about application or researching towards application, where opportunities for publishing are more limited. Equally there should be more leniency on people who have done ""industry route"" postdocs with regards to those quantitative outputs.

Edit: then for turning those into metrics for hiring, you can adjust the metrics between lots of papers, high quality papers, right skills, depending on the route.",2,0,,2024,5

These kinds of things should be measured by the interview process, and, for a university as international as NTU, by experience of previous hires.

High quality can be measured initially by impact factor, but just like number of papers this also varies drastically by field. In practice it can only be measured qualitatively and at assistant professor level this should involve consulting at least someone in the world who is capable of evaluating their proposal, assuming they tick the other boxes.",1,0,,2024,5

I know it sounds very common sense but as a person who have to witness like 5+ people per convocation who had to BUY another pair of formal shoes for like approx $50-70, this is  common. So please, bring your own formal shoes.(unless you wanna buy another pair of formal shoes then go ahead).

P.s. The ushers are told to reject the graduates if they are not in proper attire. They are also legit told to ask graduates to buy a new pair of formal shoes. (Even the staff, some were lucky and were not caught)

Also if I am not wrong, for muslims(i think), if you are not allowed to shake hands due to religion purposes, you are allowed to raise up to the usher while lining up to get your degree. They have a seperate procedure to prevent the person handing out your degree from shaking your hand.

Like you I mentioned, I too had another internship that aligned more with my career interests, couldn't pass this opp up etc. Just be genuine and honest ah they can't stop you. They will just do their due diligence to 'uphold' NTUs reputation.

I think in general for interviews they care more about your passion for the subject/ whether you have direction in life/ interesting stuff to say than your actual technical knowledge bcuz your results already speak for itself
so do show that you have such qualities! 

For interview I js prepared some commonly asked questions like:
Introduce yourself 
Who is your role model ?
What job do you envision yourself doing in the future ?
Why did you pick your preferred major ?
Share a topic in the major that you enjoy? 
How could you contribute to the school ?

If you had a write up for the admissions they‚Äôll def ask you qns on it too so do rmbr what you wrote 

I think just be confident and chill, for the interviews I went for the profs were mostly friendly and interested on knowing more about me than grilling me so don‚Äôt be too tense and you‚Äôll be fine!

Good luck for your interview !!",2,0,,2024,5

Don't read too much into the QS ranking.

As to the courses, I feel the general undergraduate education is similar to those of the top 30-50 universities in the US.

And before, I have actually spent 1 year in one of the top uni in my own country (ITB). So comparing my experience in both, I can say that with their own ups and downs, NUS/NTU is objectively better than whatever my country uni has to offer lol.

If the student here ever felt that the profs/ admins are incompetent. I just want to let u know the 100+ ranks uni are like worse üò≠ (this is only regarding teaching style, and how hard it is to approach the admins). Also if they felt like nus got a lot of useless students in group projects, my old uni got it worse also :')

Of course all of is really relative on what u are comparing to. I'm comparing NUS/NTU with like indo uni lol. If you come from like the US the its prolly a different story. U should also compare things like
- quality and opportunitites for your specific major
- what non-academic opportunities are u looking for in your target country
- do you enjoy research or go straight into industry etc etc.

Cause if the QS focuses on for example research, then it would be good for you if u actually have a passion for research. Become an intern at a lab, have your own project in the lab. If the QS focuses on graduate employability, then find out why they are employable, for example I notice that the average SG students have at least like 2-3 internships stacked in their CV when they graduate. Meaning there are actually a lot of internship opportunitites in that country.

My point is, ppl can always have something to somplain for. If you ahve done your own judgement and feel like NTU is the best option for u the just go for it lah.",9,0,,2024,5

Usually in Singapore, its not the uni that matters but the course imo. Like overall ppl say nus>ntu, but u cant say this for thing like communications where its generally accepted that wkw is better. Engineering and biz too, since both are very closely ranked against nus (not to mention, engi and biz in ntu are the OG engi & biz. The old nus biz faculty migrated to the current ntu biz faculty).

But I've seen these negative sentiment amongst courses like cs when in comparison to nus ah (saw from ur post history that u're from ntu cs, which could be why). Ultimately rankings in sg generally doesnt matter. But if it matters in your home country, and ntu has made a name for itself, then yes, u made the right choice coming to ntu cs since reputation & rankings tend to matter more in other countries (its for yourself to decide/say). 

This is esp so when I'm here on exchange. The uni I'm in isnt known at all in sg, but makes a big name for itself in france. Same goes to my german friends telling me how big their university is in germany but is easily considered a no name for us Singaporeans. However, in such bigger countries, rankings do actually play a part for them, so if they're able to land good jobs in their country because of their uni, good for them. So dont be swayed by the negative comments among Singaporeans. If you intend to go back to your home country where ntu has a big name, thats great, and you know what u're doing.",5,0,,2024,5

Notwithstanding, the operator was sternly warned to adhere to proper food safety practices at all times and increase the frequency of their pest treatment measures to mitigate the issue. We will continue to monitor the premises to ensure compliance to food safety and will not hesitate to take enforcement action should any lapses be detected.‚Äù
  
I guess either there are really no flies after a short 2 days or I hallucinated some flies when I went there wtf LOL 

conclusion: if you see flies again just report to SFA, the flies will disappear üòÇ

Travelling part I‚Äôm mostly okay since it‚Äôs a vacation but every meal my friend makes all of us take a selfie and lift rides and grab ride also have to take mirror selfie. Driving to woodlands checkpoint also take bus selfie and these are multiple photos not just one. When everyone is super shag aft physical games also have to stop and take a selfie. Even worst we walking to North Spine also take selfie. 

I‚Äôm honestly quite tired of all the selfies and actually wonder whether this friend has so much storage on the phone ü§£ü§£

458,Post,1czdl3t,Dealing with criticism,LeadTheWayThruDeRain,2024-05-24 05:41:08+00:00,"Hi guys, NTU offered me computer science a while back, and I was so happy when I found out, but after absorbing all the negativity around me, its become increasingly difficult for me to maintain that same joy.

After sharing the good news, I have peers telling me that ntu cs is only second grade to nus and is always known as the nus reject where cmi people go. Or that the syllabus is way outdated and a relative waste of time with poor teaching. Even worse, that ntu cs grads are not as respected by companies in the workplace even to SMU as reflected in the GES and will be 2nd class citizen in the office just like a nurse to a doctor. I also shared that I was interested in ECDS but was shot down that these data science courses are only fluffs built upon the excitement of technology boom and will soon die out and become irrelevant.

I know that my friends are simply just giving me their genuine thoughts and advice, and are not looking to bring me down. But I can't lie and say that after a while all these negatives have really started getting to me, and making me question this joy if I should put my eggs in this basket.

CS seniors, do you really have such regrets joining this course? Doesn't help that I'm conflicted on whether to appeal to ECDS as well, as the economics concept interests me plus i'm not that sure on a full blown programming commitment, though I acknowledge that cs grads can do the jobscope of ecds but not vice versa.

Add: Thank you so much everyone for the kind words and overwhelming support on the situation. I‚Äôve read through all the comments and though I can‚Äôt reply to every single one, I‚Äôve come to strengthen my belief that others‚Äô thoughts are others‚Äô, and mine are mine.

the only people who buy into the idea that ntu are nus rejects are those who truly think that they are inferior to people in nus. or who are rejected by nus. i feel that if ppl not happy think ntu are nus rejects, they always have option to go elsewhere (the other 4 unis, or overseas etc). its absolutely annoying that ntu grads talk bad about their own school, cause afaik, nus and ntu offer similar opportunities at undergrad.

 I emailed the company directly for the internship opportunity and stated my availability which was the full 12 weeks of my summer break. After a month they replied and told me they the department is open for intern and it was a role which I‚Äôm keen to pivot into after graduation. 

My first round of interview was 2 weeks before my 12 weeks of summer break starts and after 2 weeks of no updates, I emailed HR and they explained that the hiring manager was out of town and subsequently scheduled the final round of interview with me the next following week, at this point it was already 2 weeks into my 12 weeks of summer break so I only had 10 weeks left. 

During final round interview, the manager ask when I commit til and I say i can only commit til aug since sch starts and he said they will discuss further and let me know by this week and today I received an email telling me that i got rejected because they needed me to commit full 12 weeks but I have less than 12 weeks to commit now because this whole process took so long.

 I was looking forward to internship after being rejected and ghosted by countless companiesüò≠üò≠

Also the fault is not with the number of rounds, that‚Äôs just how they assess interns fit for the company.

First, email the company (or call them, if you have their number - time is of the essence) and tell them you can commit and can start immediately. 

It's not too big an issue to miss the lessons, so your next step is email your prof and let them know of the situation (especially if you're going to be missing classes) but will still be closely following the content to make sure you won't be a hindrance to the class by asking inane questions (or any other variation of ""I'm doing this for your benefit, prof""). They won't mark you down for attendance. Even if you won't be missing class, can just give them a heads up anyway. It puts you on the radar out of the sea of students which you can then capitalise on throughout the rest of the semester. 

On the side, make sure you're looking through the 2 weeks of content to make sure you're not missing anything important. While there are mods that have fluff content in the first 2 weeks, there are also many that build on the fundamentals from those 2 weeks. Try to find out which one your mods fall under and adjust accordingly.

If you're able to WFH for your internship, (obviously) try to put those days to be on the days you need to be in class. Remain contactable and make sure your work is still done up to quality and on time. Don't tell your company you're at class. If you need to, OT to put those hours back.",2,0,,2024,5

An individual being vocal about the palestinian cause does not entail that they are unsympathetic to other causes concerning crimes against humanity (e.g. what‚Äôs happening in syria, yemen, rohingya, china etc.). If you pitiful lot think a little, you‚Äôd see that there are several reasons why more attention is given to the palestinian cause over these other causes, not least because the genocide in palestine is overwhelmingly well-documented and publicised at the present moment. We literally have daily mass-transmitted reports with visual evidence of civilians being killed by israel. And given, among other things, 1) the rate and scope of israeli attacks against palestinians (refugee camps, hospitals, schools destroyed & entire bloodlines wiped out daily), 2) the *explicit* (i.e. public) pronouncement to flatten gaza by israeli officials, and 3) the *explicit* disregard for international law by israel, it is understandable why the palestinian cause seems to demand a relatively greater urgency over other causes right now.

In any case, you pitiful lot reveal yourselves to be lowly cowards who are quick to anger at proponents of justice but slow to anger at criminals committing genocide. You attempt to veil your moral bankruptcy with your whataboutisms, thinking we wouldn‚Äôt see through your pretensions to pragmatism & so-called fairness.

Any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

(a) Killing members of the group;

(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;

(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;

(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

Doesn‚Äôt differentiate one of military/sex/gender. But broadly talks about people being in a particular area. 

Importantly, the victims of genocide are deliberately targeted - not randomly ‚Äì because of their real or perceived membership of one of the four groups protected under the Convention. This means that the target of destruction must be the group, as such, and not its members as individuals. Genocide can also be committed against only a part of the group, as long as that part is identifiable (including within a geographically limited area) and ‚Äúsubstantial.‚Äù

Because this made up point doesn't exist in the convention.

The genocide convention was made because of the holocaust. Jews were killed in concentration camps, not Nazi military personnels.

There are many post from others who is thinking of dropping out and feeling so lonely in such a crowded big uni. I was one of those post under a throwaway account.   
During entry into uni, it was still covid thus no physical orientation and heck, I even forgot about the online orientation date thus didn't attend. I wanted a fresh start and a nice interesting university life, it wasn't. I came from Business Information Technology diploma and assumed this degree would be similar, I was not prepared for the math so much that I failed both my math module in year 1 sem 1 even though math was my strong suit. I was utterly devastated and wanted to drop out. I still 'had' friends who would study after class for a few session but I just wasn't the study type like them so we drifted away. Ignoring the 2 failed math mod, I started my GPA at 4.0, looks impressive but spoiler alert, I graduated now at 3.02.   
For the next 2 semester, I no longer had friend in uni, I was in a toxic relationship and saw a semester GPA of 2.0, I was called to meet my mentor or whatever that role is (those we know, know how useless it is). I wrote a few post on throwaway account seeking help here in this subreddit, asking if anyone want to be friend or should I just drop out. I dont know how but I was just drifting through this period of time trying to stay afloat and not break my parent's dream of me graduating from a local university which is a first for my family.   
Over time during the next 2 years of uni, I was just constantly thinking of dropping out and feeling the wave of loneliness when I walk by north spine with everyone in groups or their friends chatting and having fun while I'm there, I'm right there beside everyone but the whole university felt like a ghost town to me.   
I slowly made the change to seek out new environment to be in, extend my network and get to know more people outside of uni. It was slowly getting better knowing this period of 'uni life' doesn't have to focus on uni. I hardly physically go to uni anymore and skip out on work while doing bare minimum and putting my hardest for group projects since I do not want to drag others even though I'm dragging myself down.   
Soon after it was internship which was a really great change of pace for me and then FYP came and I was glad my professor helped me throughout the way. Before I know it, I am now reading the email of application for convocation. I know I will be there with no friend from uni but I am doing it for myself and my parents to see me graduate.  
Hope one day for those who are struggling or feeling lonely in uni can push through too and somehow you are graduating as well. ",177,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1ddn7fn/not_a_motivation_propaganda_just_a_summary_of_4/,2024,6

Not studying CS (can't imagine myself doing that, I think my brain will explode). I really relate with what you mean by it feeling so surreal for getting into uni, as it was not part of my plan to go to uni. There are a bunch of reasons but I won't bore you with the details. For the first time in my life, I experienced difficulty in connecting with people, mostly because I view myself as an outsider/ an outlier of the system (got in through ABA & igpa was barely at the 10th percentile). Suddenly I am surrounded by all these smart people. Honestly, I still feel alone most of the time, especially when people gave comments like ""its easy to get a B"", ""its only year 1"", without giving much empathy or help. I have learnt so much about myself for the past 1 year, especially how I have to be kind to myself (after what I have been through in my life) & that comparison is the thief of joy. I might not be able to graduate with an honours (really did tried but the competition plus my anxiety really got the best of me). Do you (or anyone reading this) have any advice for me on living my uni life to my fullest? Still have 3 more years to go & I intend to make a best of it!",6,0,,2024,6

Yes I managed to find a job before I graduated. But I worked there for a month before realising it was not a good fit in terms of job scope. I left. I spent a few months looking before being able to land another contract job before the year ended. (both are in the govt sector btw)

Well I stayed for a few months before I resigned again, without another job lined up. First few months were great, my bosses were quite supportive which motivated me to stay (and rejected a solid FT offer from another co). Then shit happened and I found myself constantly being gaslighted and belittled by the same bosses who I realised baited me with their fake generosity and kindness. at one point i was crying in the office almost every week lol. I left that place feeling super disillusioned and jaded by what happened.

so yeah, moral of the story is, it's better to stay unemployed (or at least work pt) and have a somewhat intact mental health, than to rush into a toxic work environment for the income and destroying yourself in the process. take your time, if it's meant to be yours then it will be yours.",162,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1d9m3s8/for_graduating_students_if_you_havent_found_a_job/,2024,6

288,Post,1dpykc2,Advice to freshers ,yearningpoet,2024-06-27 18:35:32+00:00,"This post is for freshmen joining this year! Congratulations on getting accepted! It's a great accomplishment and frankly, you should be proud of it.üíØüåü

So, I'm from ADM, currently going to y3, I've been in around 6 CCA clubs and participated in multiple events, so you can say I'm quite involved as a person when it comes to campus life. Here's my advice as a senior, to everyone who are feeling nervous about starting uni life!

1) **Be not afraid** : Starting uni is so nerve-wracking. You are gonna be overwhelmed by a whole new system, Group projects, orientation etc etc. It's only natural, to feel nervous and believe you might not do as well as you expected. The thing about uni life, especially in year 1, is that it's rigorous and tries to introduce you to challenges all at once but the key to getting over it, is to 
- Seek support from fellow peers and instructors 
- Take breaks , constantly stressing over academics will leave a bad taste even after accomplishing goals and cause burnout 
- Make use of resources, the study spaces, the convenient food options, events that give you freebies, just try to integrate and assimilate with the environment.
- Try to find people who share similar interests as you and join clubs that appeal to you as well 

2) **Ask** : Don't be hesitant when it comes to asking questions about courses. This app is really good when it comes to answering very specific questions about the mods. Feel free to ask your instructors to help you out, there's even a CommsCube to help you out with assignments and stuff and don't shy away from using these things because these are all there for your own benefit 
https://www.ntu.edu.sg/lcc/about-us/lcc-communication-cube

3) **Don't overdo** : We all wanna outshine and be the best. But there's a fine line with doing everything and getting extremely exhausted and burnt out from work. Don't join too many CCA's, stick to one or two per year. Try not to overload everything at once, it is seriously not worth it. There should be room for self reflection and enjoyment and one shouldn't limit themselves to just uni life. Hang out with friends, read books, travel and taking that time off, really inspires even more creativity and thinking. 


4) **Health is wealth** : Most overused sentence but the amount of people who started pulling all nighters after joining uni is concerning. Hey, if you pull all nighter one day please atleast catch up on it the next day. Don't leave things for last minute or if U do, prioritise things that are due more earlier or important. Sleep is important and eating healthy is too. Don't stick to just fast foods or instant food. There's even some healthy options at convenience stores and supermarkets now. Take care , not just of Ur physical health but also your mental health.

Lastly, do attend all the career events, cultural and art events (usually at North spine ) and hey, NTU FEST is coming back this August and it's gonna be filled with fun and multiple activities for you guys to enjoy so do come !!


**What apps should you install?**

1) NTU OMNIBUS : Good for checking bus timings , usually updated 
2) Cates ; Ordering food from eateries 
3) Intellect : NTU has partnership with this app and all students get free access to premium materials and can even book sessions with counsellors. 
4) Canva : Good for presentations, collaborating with people (you can use your NTU email for education purposes)
5) Notion : Good for organising purposes (NTU also has tieups with this )

303,Post,1d66rbj,another SA case covered up by NTU?,Fabulous-Art3821,2024-06-02 06:11:14+00:00,"Hi. I was a JCRC member last year and nearing IHG I heard about a case in my circle involving one of the hall presidents committing SA on a hall resident.

I didn't think much about this case until my JCRC friends brought up the latest mothership article with the criminal verdict and it was so disgusting how NTU covered this up and let the guy get away scot-free? 

As hall council, hall safety has always been one of my biggest concerns. And it angers me painfully that this case was swept under the rug by NTU (inserted their Straits Times statement). 

Heard the update that the guy that committed this act is back on campus as well and allowed back into various CCAs. He even posted this awful caption that seeks to elicit sympathy and made himself sound like the victim. 

What's even more shocking to me is the amount of people sympathising with him in the comments because he's quite pops? Every single one of these people should be placed on a watchlist.  

Why do we keep giving major leadership positions in NTU to people of questionable character? And why did Mothership censor his name even though Straits' Times released it already?

Your mum doesn't know what it takes to go through the EEE curriculum. Quite literally nobody I've interacted with from EEE over the years have ever said anything along the lines of ""Oh EEE was easy LOL""; it is always about reminiscing the pain we went through and complaining about the difficult days back then. For what it's worth, my parents say quite a lot of hurtful things to me even now after I've started working, but they have NEVER pissed on my university grades since both of them came from NTU EEE as well so I think they knew the shit I went through (ok but maybe I didn't tell them my grades also; just goes to show that not everything needs to be mentioned lol).

With the above said, take heart that you've survived really one of the toughest courses in NTU. The need for external validation is tempting, but always keep in mind that internal validation from the heart must always be the core of your sense of self-worth; anything and everything else should be viewed as an unexpected bonus. This applies to work as well.

P.S. after you get a job, please keep your salary number to yourself and don't tell your parents or you'll never hear the end of their comparison. Working life is hard enough as it is. You don't need to go home to another round of negativity after a long day at the office.

2. mine is old school method - attend lectures and tutorials. during y1 when things weren't too hard to comprehend, i tried to read the notes before each class so i can follow the lecture flow better, but i gave up when my brain couldnt catch up. i print out hardcopy notes because i prefer writing the explanatory notes on the paper. i dont make summarized notes on a separate paper cos no time
3. 80/20 rule. the prof cant test you on every single thing. go through past years and midterm papers, some questions are more likely to come out.
4. i used spaced repetition when i planned my revision schedule (usually 1 month before exam). eg if i have 5 days to prep subject A (exam on day 6) and subject B (day 7), my schedule would look like this: day 1 - B day 2 - B day 3 - A day 4 - A day 5 - blank (always leave blank), skim through whatever you have read, at this point you dont want your brain to be too tense and stressed day 6 - B
5. rest well before exam day. even saf tells you 7hrs of rest is important",3,0,,2024,6

TLDR, didn't enjoy my degree at all, struggled my 3.5 years (even though i'm DY2, extended another sem), had to take supplementary papers after my last sem because i failed 2 mods. graduated with slightly above 2 GPA.  
  
started job hunting only in march (yes late, because i wasn't even sure i could pass my supplementary papers). i wanted to pivot out of engineering because i was very sure this wasn't what i wanted to do as a career. i have a keen passion in business operations and strategy, liked the idea of rotation thus applied for mostly graduate programs and management associate roles! 

some background about myself: in my 3.5 years in engineering i only did one professional internship but i mentored and volunteered for a non-profit organisation consistently (weekend and weekdays) for the last 4 years. was in a sports CCA and played SUNIG and IVP. 

sent out close to a 100 resumes, but each of my resume's objective was curated to the role/company i applied. landed about 5 interviews, 2 of which proceeded to the final round and i was finally offered a MA role for a MNC :') 

nothing to boast, in fact this whole process was full of doubt and many what ifs (what if i changed my course, what if i took up more internships etc). to all those struggling in school, YOU WILL MAKE IT. a bad grade isn't the end!!!! attitude is key and what employers look out for, how you carry yourself is important. uni isn't easy and don't do it alone.

The only reason why I chose NTU was that apparently it‚Äôs easier to get hall + less admin hassle. Also from what I infer, it seems easier to do well here with less competition. But apparently hall is not guaranteed for freshies? My main worry is that I plan to go to grad school and from what I heard, NTU isnt looked upon favourably for economics by Ivies/Oxbridge.

From a degree and quality of education perspective, doesn't matter which uni you go to. Either uni on your resume will be a solid seal of certification saying that you went to a top uni.

I keep seeing people complaining about NTU vs NUS all the time, which reminds me of a typical squabble between an XBOX and PlayStation fanboy.

For me, these 2 uni are waaaaaaaayyy better than the ones in my country, and that's all that matters. I feel that ppl rly don't appreciate what they have here and instead engage in this unnecessary war.

I picked NTU over NUS with similar reasons as you, cheaper and same knowledge, why not

Something I experienced in NTU 
1. Freaking noisy LT especially when prof can't speak fluent English 

2. Good prof left due to politics (I mean real good kind that they can even don't teach with lecture notes), or due to lack of research results (maybe too focus on teaching instead of bringing in funding to the school)

3. Admin staff with poor service quality and their attitude is annoying (trying to slack at job then always find excuses like ""you are good enough to study in NTU so I expect you can solve it yourself"")

For now, as I look back, which school also doesn't really matter as long as you're good at what you study. I got colleagues from NUS too, not really can tell the difference. I got a job offer one year before graduate and taking above average paycheck among the peers just after a few years, if future salary matters to you too

Lastly I think aside of academy, what are important that set you apart after school is your logical thinking skill, arts of talking, and how to work as a team

Hope this 3min read helps you.. last time I also was thinking too much lol but no one can ask for advices haha",10,0,,2024,6

But more about you, what you're experiencing is known as loss aversion in behavioral economics. The specific phenomenon of comparing yourself to others and imagining a potential loss is FOMO. A lot of student/pre u student behavior is driven by this. For example most of it is FOMO/anxiety driven. 99.9% of JC kids aim for schools out of a mix of anxiety and loss aversion. Virtually none know anything concrete about their schools other than FOMOing that X is more prestigious than Y. If you are experiencing this, pick NUS.

i did :) i just got offered hall 4 (one of the more popular halls) with 7 points. it is big, with ac, and clean.

as for decent room type, i think it boils down to personal preference. everyone prefer different halls. if you‚Äôre not picky, tamarind, north hill are easy to get halls cause not a lot of people fight for them.

as for points, 3 points is easy to get ‚Äî i am in a cca whereby i am just a member, have not attended anything and i just get 3 points for that.

you can secure an additional 2 points by applying for a double room with an international student.

generally 5-7 points are good enough for a hall as a senior.

if you want to have 7 or 9, you do need to hold a leadership position.

finally, just want to add on, hall points does not come from hall cca. as long as it is a cca in ntu, it qualifies. that‚Äôs where ntu and nus hall differs! :)",1,0,,2024,6

Re-plan your curriculum taking strategy down the road, keep an equal balance of hard and easy or manageable mods every semester. So you can spread your resources equally to keep your gpa afloat. Get the easy mods to cushion poor gpa from hard ones. 

Relook at your studying strategy and tactics and observe your friends, see what they're doing correctly that you aren't doing right.

For the rest of the mods, it's not really essential to complete them in the next year if you feel like you need a break from them. I myself and a couple other friends are choosing to take Business Law in Y3S2 just because we needed a break from the heavy content. I, too, had a delay in specialising in my first sem of Y2. I managed to get it in Y2S2 though so don't worry!

As for your GPA, I too got a 2.90-ish grade but that was in Y2S1. I managed to pull it up to a 3.3 in one semester though so it's really quite doable! Make sure to find A grade past year examples for all your group projects and follow them religiously! You'll do fine :) Things will also look up once you get your specialisation because it's at least something you're interested in instead of the general business mods. 

I only got my internship in Y3S1 (Work Study Degree), so there's really no rush. As long as you complete all your modules, including the internship, before you graduate, all is good! Also, perhaps taking on an internship post specialisation is beneficial because you know exactly what sort of role/company you're looking for, rather than going for a general intern job. 

If you're genuinely curious about the WSD, you can take it for one semester. It requires a min duration of 35 weeks for you to clear your PA. There should be emails from the school on your outlook as well about it. 

Hope you feel a little less alone in this journey! And remember, we're studying business so even if we take a little longer than the rest of our peers to graduate, we would still be on track with the rest who are studying 4 year courses :)",2,0,,2024,6

If you don't want to appeal for marketing, I think your best choice would be to go for your 2nd choice. If you havent really thought about it, do some research on what career prospects the respective specialisations will give you. Quite important especially if you don't want to start from ground 0 when you go out to the working world. 

I believe you can appeal via emailing nbs course registration! If they don't reply you within 3 working days, just call the office because they might miss out on your email.

Honestly, you should apply for hall for the convenience & hall culture if you're keen to. Personally, I don't participate in hall stuff because I'm not interested in it lol (am more involved in Muslim Soc) but I'm sure people are nice enough to respect our beliefs. I do have some malay/muslim friends who participate in IHG and it went perfectly fine so don't worry\~ The drinking/party culture won't happen during CCA sessions but maybe afterwards or just during social settings.  


There are quite a number of malay/muslim people who stay in hall, I would think that we don't usually post it on social media haha. During Ramadan, I was fortunate to have a group of girl friends to sahur everyday & terawih with so it was a wholesome experience. Don't worry, you can always join clubs like Perbayu or Muslim Society to get to know other people too! (I am also an extrovert LOL)That was how I knew a few people who stayed in hall.

Psychiatrists are able to diagnose you and write an official letter for you to explain your mental health diagnosis and situation. This official letter will likely be accepted as extenuating circumstances. 

And of course your appeal should also mention how you are currently coping, your improvement for this sem and how you plan to continue to pull up your GPA.

You need to remove all thoughts about dropping out as it‚Äôs already into the halfway mark. Here‚Äôs what you need to do. Look at your course modules and jot down 

1)How much more AUs needed for graduation 
2)Which prerequisite modules you might have failed and need for further advancement. 

I need you to overload 1 to 3 more modules per semester to complete your degree on time. If prerequisite modules are not offered this semester then you just have to roll with other mods first.

my advice is to do the bare minimum. at least show up for classes, submit what you need to (incomplete and on time is better than late/never submit in my experience), attend the exams

i had a job abt one month aft my final exam and it was unrelated to my degree and i did not include my gpa in my resume

honestly, i believe employers nowadays dont look at gpa (unless u wanna go to a very reputable company). what matters is ur passion, what relevant skillsets you have and your willingness to learn.

if you need more time, dont be afraid to take an extra sem to complete your studies or try and clear some mods during summer break (thats what i did)

can always apply for a loan or if youre taking less mods in a semester, you may hv more time to work pt to fund your following semester

i do know of someone who withdrew in their final year and is currently employed (diploma pay) and they are happy doing what theyre doing now. 

theres no right or wrong answer tbh, but you would just have to bear in mind what you would need to do and what consequences youre willing to face for either decision you make

Study tips: Take down whatever notes your prof write , don‚Äôt be lazy and procrastinate ( ask your questions to prof/TA directly or through emails ) Most of them are really helpful and profs are willing to arrange for physical consultations.

Also , never do last minute study. We can start studying for a test / finals early and doing a few chapters per day so that we give our mind to consolidate all the new information. Afterwards, challenge yourself to write out the information that we have recalled without referring back to our notes . Practise this again and again, you will definitely be more confident in yourself. Don‚Äôt think that your questions are stupid because clarification is better than ignorant . 

Sometimes , people may say people who are actively participating in tutorials are class sluts but when you are more engaged , you tend to be more interested in the topic

I also face some heartbreaks in school , it affected me a lot until the point I felt depressed and no mood to study. It‚Äôs tough very very tough , sometimes we may look at the past and ask ourselves why this happen. I ran almost everyday at SRC wave in school and this keeps me motivated. I became more introverted last sem but I was glad I have the support from my good friends. It is important to share our thoughts or inner feelings with people if not it gets worse till people may commit suicide or have no will to live. 

Wah, how come all my sem in NTU seem to be a new challenge. My GPA is decent 
4.26 to 4.43 to 4.48 and to 4.44

So is my goal FCH? Maybe ? But now I am not striving for FCH as much as before in Y1 or Y2S1. Sometimes I will prefer good health over grades. Good health be it mental or physical health, I hope those who are reading these take some time to relax and chill before next sem starts again , always find meaning first before mugging so hard for grades. Grades aren‚Äôt everything, the will we have to stand back up from setbacks are what it takes that will push us further in life.

I would say that the work I did after graduating aligned better with my innate skills, and it's something I am happy and comfortable doing. I think, and quite importantly, these are areas where I have ambitions and goals I want to work towards. While biology is a subject I have always liked, I found out pretty quickly that I was not cut out for the level of science/thinking/memory work my degree required. 

As to whether I thought my NTU degree was a waste... It took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I had gone and tried doing something I wasn't cut out for, but I've made my peace with it. I still very much enjoy biology but not in the way it was taught in NTU.

738,Comment,1dbua9d,sleeping in ntu overnight,DifficultyBubbly6497,2024-06-11 04:09:22+00:00,"Honestly, I think you can just ask the camp organisers if they have any place for you to sleep. They sometimes booked out LTs just for this purpose, just bring your own sleeping bag! most camps know it's hard to get back at this timing and rather you have some sort of supervision than stay somewhere unaccounted and risk something happening to you in school grounds.

Apart from what have been mentioned, air-conditioned lobbies/corridors (near LWN or at EoS) are good choices and are accessible, albeit hidden, if you don't mind a little white noise in the background. In general, there are a lot of air-conditioned places, you just need to know where are the discreet places/where to stay hidden. the routes the guards patrol are fairly predictable and they rarely go out of the way to chase you if you stay out of their sight.

if u don't require aircon, there's actually a lot more comfortable and discreet options where you won't be disturbed.",5,0,,2024,6

763,Comment,1db0maq,AMA: Nanyang Business School (NBS),Infamous_Job1080,2024-06-08 11:59:32+00:00,"Hello! For business school student clubs, most of them would take in freshmen as sub-committee members, with the exception of some that takes in freshmen as main committee members/ exco members.

If I am not wrong, some clubs require you to go for interview sessions, some require you to do case studies, and some even require to put yourself up for elections for the student body to vote. Each club has their own requirements! 

We have numerous student clubs in NBS and I think they will all have recruitment towards the first few weeks of school! 

To know about recruitment: 
1. Keep a look out during orientation (they shouted out a few clubs during orientation week and welcome day)
2. Keep a look out for your emails
3. Keep a look out for the club‚Äôs social media pages 

The next steps would be to fill up online forms that they set up to know more about yourself (with a couple of role-related questions) and thereafter schedule an interview if needed.

My most important tip If you are interested to join student clubs, is to talk to seniors who are involved in them! Most will be trying to sell you the good things about their clubs and make you really attracted to it, but don‚Äôt close your doors to the other opportunities and amazing clubs there are as well!

764,Comment,1db0maq,AMA: Nanyang Business School (NBS),Infamous_Job1080,2024-06-08 17:03:18+00:00,"Hello!

1. Timetable for Y1 students are pre-set, so all the timings and everything are allocated to you. Earliest class time is 830am, and latest class will end by 630pm. Some people get 1-2 days off if they are lucky, think if you were from poly this would be familiar to you! However, during Week 1 and 2, we have this thing called add-drop period. You can log in to NTU Stars and see if there are any slots in the classes of your preferred timings! If you don‚Äôt stay and hall and wish to come school less often, you can try your luck to see if you can cluster your classes together into a few days. Though whether this is a good move also depends, because some modules have lots of presentation and assignments, and it might be too much for one to handle if the assignments and presentations are due to happen on the same day.

2. For faculty orientation, you will not be with your classmates. Everyone will be mixed, so expect to mingle around with everyone from NBS, they may be from Business, Accounting, or from the double degree programme. Same for Welcome Day. Unfortunately, there aren‚Äôt any avenues for you to meet your classmates until class time. There will only be a few familiar faces (say less than 10) that will be in the same class as you for all the modules. 

3. Nope no disadvantage at all! For specialisation wise, each specialisation has a requirement for students, and for marketing the requirement is to get B for Marketing module and C+ for Statistics module. I have a few friends who were exempted from Marketing like you and still got into the Marketing specialisation, so no worries on that. To exempt from marketing, there is a portal that you have to go in and submit your exemption request before a certain date. The notice that your exemption request is successful or not should come in during or by the first two weeks of school, so don‚Äôt be too alarmed if your timetable still has the module allocated! If anything, drop the school an email to clarify :)

Hope this helps!",4,0,,2024,6
765,Comment,1db0maq,AMA: Nanyang Business School (NBS),Infamous_Job1080,2024-06-08 12:32:59+00:00,"Hello! Let me try to answer with whatever I know, not sure if anything will change for your year though (unlikely).

NBS students will be split into two groups (because there are just too many students in the school), we call them Group A and Group B. Whichever group you get is really dependent on your luck, you don‚Äôt get to choose. Oh you don‚Äôt get to choose which module to take in that semester too! Everything is pre-set.

In Semester 1, Group A students will take modules from the Group A basket. This set of modules are definitely more mathematics/ calculation related, with less project work, so if you are someone who does well in this aspect, try your best to score during this semester! This group of modules consists of:  
- Financial Management (two presentations and one closed book final paper)
- Python (two projects and one final paper with cheat sheet)
- Financial Accounting (one presentation and one closed book final paper)
- Economics (two quizzes and one closed book final paper
- CC1 (tldr it‚Äôs an essay writing and presentation module, quite a few components)
- CC2 (tldr it‚Äôs a module to intro you to tech, quite a few components)

Group B students will take modules from the Group B basket, this set of modules are less heavy on mathematics and calculation, and rather heavy on project works. If you‚Äôre someone who does well in projects and design thinking related stuff, this is the semester for you to score. This group of modules consists of:
- Organisational Behavior (many project and presentations, no final paper)
- Marketing (many project and presentations, no final paper)
- Business Law (one presentation and one open book final paper)
- Statistics (one project and two quizzes with cheat sheet) 
- CC3 (aka ethics, one presentation and one quiz)
- ML4 (a module for problem solving and innovation iirc, one main presentation and many other components)

After Semester 1 ends, you will basically take the other basket of modules you didn‚Äôt take yet. Try to know your strength and weaknesses and aim to score well for the modules you are good at. Every week, you are required to do up your self-learning, readings and tutorials. Maybe your time management would be better than mine but there will come to a point where you are unable to catch up with all these weekly tasks, just because there are so many submissions and assignments to rush for. Don‚Äôt worry too much about it, because many students tend to only rush everything towards the few weeks nearing exam week.

Most importantly! Have fun and have a life and don‚Äôt focus only on academics. This is the last few years to enjoy and fool around before you enter the workforce full-time. You only have six semesters, and each semester is only about 4-5 months long. This is something I am working on myself too but I really hope everyone enjoy their time in uni with their friends rather than cooping in the room mugging away! Cheers :)",7,0,,2024,6

You may refer to the first point [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/hQNtA2oTAp) to know more about timetable!

Expect your workload to be heavy towards the later part of the semester‚Ä¶ Projects/ assignments/ presentations/ etc usually are due within the same few weeks, and you have to prepare for them beforehand. Last minute works too if you‚Äôre good at that. On top of these, you still have your weekly readings and tutorials to do, where some are mandatory and tracked. But you‚Äôll sooner or later you‚Äôll find how to work your way around managing your time and prioritising your workload (if you have the resources and materials from your seniors or friends). 

Definitely I would say NBS isn‚Äôt as tough and heavy as other degrees, first few weeks of the semester is rather light and manageable in fact! Things will start to pick up after recess week, so do keep a lookout for that and pace yourself.

1. This really depends on the hall you are applying to, different hall has different requirements! If the senior rec-ing you is someone of power/ influence in the hall of course he/ she would be able to slot you in easily! I don‚Äôt think there is a requirement per se that he/ she has to stay in the hall in order to rec you. Does your senior know the JCRC team in the hall you‚Äôre interested in? If yes then there‚Äôs a pretty good chance he/ she can help you :)

2. Again, different halls have different requirements. Of course your talent and your skills would be a huge plus point, from dancing, to singing, to sports, to even your intention to join the JCRC team, anything can be used as a brownie point for yourself. Some halls are less popular than others, and the freshie rec list may not be filled up, so as long as you apply you stand a pretty good chance to enter!

3. Every hall differs, but the period to apply is now. Some of the deadlines are as early as 9 June. Do ask around whoever you for the forms or look up the hall‚Äôs IG pages or Tele channels for the rec list. 

4. Every hall is lively and fun if you choose to make it lively and fun. Depends on your definition! Maybe you can share what you envision your hall life to be hahah (like wholesome kind of fun or drinking partying kind of fun). Do you want the fun and liveliness to be with a group of friends, or do you want it to be an entire hall of fun and liveliness? There are many listicles out there on Reddit and TikTok that share about the different hall cultures, you can take those as a reference. If you have any specific halls in mind, feel free to ask!",2,0,,2024,6
773,Comment,1db0maq,AMA: Nanyang Business School (NBS),Infamous_Job1080,2024-06-09 09:18:13+00:00,"Hello! This depends on what kind of portfolio you would like to build. 

Are you looking at growing professionally ie. building skills related to your prospective career? If this is the case, it‚Äôll be good to expose yourself to the professional clubs where they will have you more or less equipped with skills related to your career. There are clubs that specialise in consulting, investment banking, corporate banking, etc. They have rigorous trainings and competitions that teaches you related skills and background of the respective industries.  

Or are you looking at enhancing your soft skills like leadership and event planning? If this is the case, you can consider joining student clubs where they host and organise events for the student body. Certain roles also allow you to reach out to external vendors to find potential partnerships and sponsorships, so this may be a way to network too!

Or you can consider both too if you like, just be sure that you are able to cope with the workload (if you‚Äôre interested to know about workload let me know) and you don‚Äôt ghost one for the other because that will only reflect badly on yourself. Hope this helps :)",3,0,,2024,6
774,Comment,1db0maq,AMA: Nanyang Business School (NBS),Infamous_Job1080,2024-06-09 12:31:07+00:00,"Hello! Here‚Äôs my personal opinion based on what I have seen, take it with a pinch of salt!

1. I think compared to other courses, the % of Business students going exchange is higher. That being said, there is a good mix of people who choose to i) go for exchange, ii) stay in SG to continue their studies normally,  and iii) take LOA for internship. It‚Äôs normal for students to go on semestral exchange and still graduate within 3 years! That is how our school curriculum is set.

2. There isn‚Äôt any best time to go for exchange, but your choices are only Y2S1, Y2S2, and Y3S1. Depending on your personal preference tbh. I think they don‚Äôt allow students to go for semestral exchange on their last semester which is Y3S1! Securing an exchange spot is dependent on the demand and your GPA, so what most students do is to apply for Y2 exchange in Y1 and see if they can make it. If they can‚Äôt, apply again in Y2 for Y3 and pray that your new GPA makes the cut.

3. We have three kinds of exchange, Winter being 1-2 months, Summer being 2-3 months, and Semestral being 5-6 months. I would say the longer the exchange is the higher the demand. Some countries are also more popular than others, eg. Korea, Europe, etc. Some universities are also more popular than others! Oh also, each university has a certain limit to the number of students they can take, so the lower the number, the more competitive it is. For a gauge, some universities are only allowing 3 NBS students, why some allow 20 NBS students. Really dependent on the university you choose. 

Securing an internship overseas is not rare, there are cases of it happening! If you want this overseas internship to be credit bearing, there are some requirements that the company has to meet before it can be counted as credit bearing. Honestly I am not too sure about overseas internship so if anyone has experience with it feel free to chime in!

Most of the time there will be resources and materials passed down!

For most projects, trust me, you‚Äôll be either too lost or clueless where to start. You can learn from their experiences and take a look at the projects that they have done as a reference to get yourself kickstarted on the projects! 

You can‚Äôt imagine the amount of resources and notes that will be circulating around, and sadly those who don‚Äôt have these are only on the losing end‚Ä¶ Beware of plagiarism though! The school is very strict on this matter.",3,0,,2024,6

785,Comment,1db0maq,AMA: Nanyang Business School (NBS),vajraadhvan,2024-06-09 06:16:36+00:00,"I won't sugarcoat things: it will probably be a steeper learning curve without Further Maths, especially given that there isn't probability & statistics in H2 Maths. But nothing you cannot overcome, since you will be taking AB1202 Statistics and Analysis in your first year. That said, it's not taught very rigorously, so some self-studying of BA2203 Statistical Modelling may be wise. (In fact, the best course of action would be to take MH2500 in your first semester, but of course NBS doesn't allow students to take electives in Y1.)

Presentations ‚Äî most core business and ICC mods will have one or two presentations. Actuarial science mods will also typically have one, but it will not be overly technical or marked primarily on presentation skills, but rather on the content itself. You should not fear presentations. Actuaries are primarily businesspeople who happen to know a little bit of mathematics and statistics; their most important work comes from communicating decision-critical information to both technical and nontechnical audiences.

It's hard to compare between A-levels and the final exams for the actuarial core mods. They take place in totally different contexts, and place different demands on students. Sorry I can't really give you much more info than that. I would say that one should not worry too much about the relative difficulty of one's course of study. Instead, study what you will enjoy the most, and everything else will come naturally. (How to go about finding what exactly you enjoy is a different question altogether.)",1,0,,2024,6

Here, you pay 1 month deposit for a 1 year contract and 2 months deposit for a 2 year contract. I think your friend has simply been taken advantage of...¬†

Also NUS has a way worse system, with even less housing options available since you give their example. There is always some form of RNG involved in systems like these (sadly), some people get fortunate with getting hall and some don't. So I don't think comparing their situation to yours is a really a good comparison since there are so many factors at play.",4,0,,2024,7
77,Comment,1e1a8yx,ntu's hall office is the WORST ,MacsimusScamus,2024-07-13 02:58:00+00:00,"Anyways, the problem is just far beyond the housing office. Since the end of the pandemic, admissions in NTU have been on the rise each year, which means more and more people would need on-campus housing. Then there is the policy of guaranteed hall stay for y1s and y2s, which means it puts ppl like us on the lower priority. Then there is also the ever-increasing amount of positions in SAO-affiliated clubs, and getting 5 pts now requires minimum effort, which leads to an artificial inflation in the number of people with hall pts now competing against each other. So are you going to blame all the people behind this?

I understand your frustration and have been a big proponent of ""intl students should have priority for accommodation"" myself, but this is something which is flawed with the upper mgmt levels of NTU itself. Hence, that's why being mean to low-level staff isn't really going to help (I'm sure they are also trying their best to get back to everyone one by one), since all the fault lies with the upper mgmt.

In the end, it's at least better to have the security of having a roof over your head rather than nothing at all. I do feel sorry for your friend since they must have panicked from all the stress that this was causing and fell into a trap of having to pay 1 year worth of rent in one go. Again, I'm not saying to completely give up on getting hall, but not rely on it since it is about as predictable as NTU's grading system :p.

I wish you good luck in your search for housing and hall allocation results and I hope you get through it!",4,0,,2024,7

Mind you I've been here for 2 years and this is the second time, I see a very bad situation with the toilets. The poor state of toilets and the general maintenance is ....man. there's stains on the floor you can't get off and despite of the hike in fees that you have to pay for supposed ""renovations and increasing charges"", no visible changes can be seen except the exterior paint. The toilet seats are sometimes broken, there's unremovable feces stain in the toilet, that looks so unhygienic you wouldn't want to use it at all. 
I'm a bit disappointed, maybe there could be better upgrade of toilet seats/ strong floor cleaning  or maybe I'm asking for too much, but I think some basic level of hygiene and maintenance existing when getting a new room would be highly appreciated.

Not gonna send a screenshot, but to answer your question, if we go into degree audit and scroll all the way down, we can see the modules to be taken for the sem. And if we click ""View Course Timetable"", it just says ""...complete your declaration in relation to orientation...""

""Done by your hall's resident prof, every month need to do your room until swee swee, everything also clean until spotless. Hall committee's president need to diam the whole block and inspect each room for damages, dirt, dust etc. Punishment for not doing so can include having to do Corrective Work Order (clean the common hall areas) or clean the block over the weekend (with whoever else deemed living in poorly maintained, unhygienic conditions) under supervision. Repeated failure to heed warnings can result in escalation to School admin office, need to march from hall room to the NTU President's residence, can be evicted from hall as a result.""

PS: the above is 100% for satire, we're adults, you do yours I do mine, you want to be dirty up to you, just make sure you don't affect your roommate can already (esp in double room). Else, prep for a hell of a year. On top of that, since you enjoy SAF-style of life so much, I think can follow 9th core value for whatever 'contraband' you smuggle in.

The bus driver made an unexpected and dangerous acceleration when turning from Nanyang walk to Nanyang cres. Despite I have already use the handle at one hand, I was still forced to use another hand (one with my take-away) to stabilize myself in the emergency. It was a total accident, I am very sorry for any inconveniences I have caused.

If you are the unlucky one, please PM me. I will provide cleaning charges to make things right.

If you know victims, I would appreciate if you help me to relay the information.

In the event that I cannot connect with the affected individual within the next two weeks, I intend to donate to a local orphanage charity.

I literally couldn't hop into the buses for two times in a row lmao

But they are willing to spend $S100 million to build  Gaia building with high quality timber woods but ended up turning into a moldy building. There's a ton of news coverage on this lol

Just why? I don't understand. It's just bizarre that they are willing to spend that much money on a building rather than allocating some of the budgets to improve the school's facilities for the students

Campus Rider :

Facilities wise :
- Set up another resting point for drivers behind NIE, so they can take longer breaks if they do not need to charge their bus. Can start a new trip from LWN instead.
- Install freaking EV charger at the bus park if it‚Äôs not done. It‚Äôs a shame that NUS could do this at their PGP terminal but not NTU.

This girl constantly left period blood on the toilet seat, left me in the hostel room with a clogged toilet filled with her üí© before which I had to deal with, and has extremely terrible body odour.

But I put up with her for months because it‚Äôs difficult to swap my roommate.

This is the part I need help with - 
When NTU assigned the hostel fees, it was split evenly between us, and written down in text too.

However, this mf checked out 1.5 days early without telling me, and she‚Äôs expecting me to PAY HER BACK for the TWO days üíÄüíÄ (for context: it‚Äôs Europe so it‚Äôs almost $180 SGD‚Ä¶.)

The admin staff during exchange and my friends told me to ignore her because I don‚Äôt have an obligation to pay her back, but she‚Äôs been spamming me everywhere and borderline being harassing. (She found my NTU email on the NTU registry too after I ignored her texts) 

After one month, she got NTU involved to ‚Äúmediate‚Äù instead of letting the issue go.

Is this her being cheapo, or is this issue my fault? Why tf did I get a roommate like this?",258,42,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1ez3jyb/need_help_annoying_roommate_during_exchange/,2024,8

Like, say that it was understood that she needed to pay half the fees for the room regardless of how often she used it. I.e., even if you were out partying the entire exchange and have never seen your room, if the administrators were not informed, then you would still obligated to pay because they left the room empty for you. In a similar sense, if she were to leave ahead of time, the onus is on her to inform the admin staff of her decision and negotiate the excess days worth of boarding fees. 

This has nothing to do with you. Inform NTU of ^ and tell them you will not entertain further emails on the issue. You can gently suggest that NTU can negotiate with the admin staff on behalf of your room mate if they are so invested in this issue, but that you want no part in this because you have already paid your fair share.",17,0,,2024,8

I would have ignored all emails on the issue after sharing my side of the story. You are 100% in the right. This is up to the psycho to negotiate with the admin of your shared room and for NTU to step in if they feel the need to. You have no skin in the game.",9,0,,2024,8

Tong Tar was our previous campus rider‚Ä¶ company? Provider? You get the gist.

Rude drivers, dirty busses, and any complaints you may now with regards to punctuality are mild compared to what our seniors had to deal with.

The best quality of life improvement was making busses terminate at North Spine instead of Saraca hall, no more being awkwardly stranded!

Buses terminates at Saraca for Blue, Hall 11 for Red. And there‚Äôs no empty replacement bus from the last stop, they only start from the next stop. 

Where the buses are all coach buses(except for 2 City Bus & a few low entry ones), squeezing through the crowded narrow aisle with your bag and theirs.

The empty seat on the crowded bus, is definitely missing a seat cushion or occupied by some boxes. At times, we dislike sitting on the front seat that has the wheel arch. 

Getting ‚Äúkiap‚Äù by the door is so common then. You can see this appearing on UWave almost every month.

434,Post,1f2ysxf,New Flexible Grading Option (FGO),2019-2020J,2024-08-28 02:05:04+00:00,"The Flexible Grading Option allows a student to convert the grades of eligible courses to Pass or No Record grades, which are excluded from the student's cumulative GPA (CGPA). It will be effective from AY2024/25 and supersedes the existing S/U Option Policy.
 
The FGO aims to empower NTU students with greater autonomy and flexibility to shape their academic journey. Through the FGO, students are provided a safe space to try new courses, without having to worry about its potential impact on their CGPA. This encourages students not to be too focused on grades, but rather to seize every opportunity to stretch themselves and explore new areas outside their core discipline.

FGO allows students to convert the grades of eligible courses to Pass or No Record grades, which are excluded from the student's cumulative GPA (CGPA). 
 
Students can declare the FGO on eligible courses taken in any semester during any declaration period before their graduation, subject to the quota of FGO Academic Units (AU) for their degree programmes. 
 
After the FGO declaration, grades will be converted to Pass/Fail.

Following the declaration, students' CGPA for the latest semester will be recomputed to reflect the FGO-declared courses. Students will only receive AU for FGO-declared courses with Pass grades.

The FGO can be applied to up to 12 AUs for three-year, four-year degree programmes (except Biomedical Sciences) and five-year programmes, and up to 9 AUs for direct entry programmes and Biomedical Sciences programme.
 
The FGO can be applied to:

1. Broadening and Deepening Electives (BDE): Courses to broaden and deepen students' learning experience

2. Major Prescribed Electives offered with a BDE option (MPE-BDE): Selected courses that undergraduates can take for specialisation in a particular degree programme or to broaden your learning

Source: NTU Intranet

TLDR: We can now S/U up to 12 AUs after seeing our AY24/25 Sem 1 course results. However, eligible courses are limited to Broadening & Deepening Electives (BDEs) & Major Prescribed Electives (MPEs) with an BDE option.

Well, guess what? Every single day I've been in school since this semester started, I have been approached at least once by these people again. 

That's genuinely fking CRAZY. HOW HARD ARE THESE PEOPLE HUNTING??? I'm getting approached literally every single day!

If you belong to any christian society or bible study group that is an NTU club, and you know members who are doing this, REIN THEM IN. This isn't the proper way to perform any form of outreach, and I say that while being a Christian myself.

Just 5 minutes before posting this, I got approached by another girl who called herself Eileen who tried to tell me about the same stuff, so I just cut her off and told her that I know what she's gonna say, and I am already a Christian and have my own care group.

I just want my quiet time during lunch and my study time to be uninterrupted. I hate explaining everyday to random strangers that, yes, I'm already a christian, and no, I do not need a bible study group. 

EDIT: BROOOO I GOT APPROACHED AGAIN. THAT IS TWICE WITHIN A 30 MINUTE PERIOD. STOP THIS NONSENSE. ",177,82,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1exjf0e/roaming_christian_duos_are_back_again/,2024,8

All scripture is God-breathed and useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,

Luke 6:41-42  
""Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.""  
  
Wanting to encourage people to love others as God commanded shouldn't be seen as something negative. Why would God wish for us to hate each other?  
  
Mark 12:31 NIV  
""The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.""

Regarding Matthew 6:5-6, I am merely trying to guide him on the right path. I do not deserve glory, nor do I seek or need it. What good can glory bring to me? I am a sinner, just like you, who can only be saved through grace alone.

You refuting what I have quoted simply because I wanted to help OP be more accepting of others shows that you do not love them.

Matthew 23:28 NIV  
In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.

Think of OP's attitude towards those preaching the gospel; all they wanted was to save people from destruction and yet he gave such an insensitive reply.

Me wanting to change his mindset towards preachers of the gospel should be seen as a positive change. Although he finds them annoying, I pray that he accepts them with open arms.

We may not be perfect, but we should strive towards living righteously.

Gonna quote this again:  
  
**Luke 9:50 NIV ""Do not stop him."" Jesus said. ""For whoever is not against you is for you.""**

2) The core problem with tutorials is that it doesn‚Äôt value add. Most people that I see that go for tutorials mainly hang around for 1-2 week to see whether the TAs are good in explaining, however in most cases the TAs can barely even converse in English before asking u the golden ‚Äú‰Ω†‰ºöËØ¥‰∏≠ÊñáÂêóÔºü‚Äù to explain. Even so, most of them just simply read off from slides which you can do as well in your free time.

Interesting read here: https://cte-blog.uwaterloo.ca/why-do-some-students-choose-not-attend-the-tutorials-walid-omran-international-ta-developer/

While there are competent TAs and Profs (though not all) conducting tutorials, if most tutorials are just a session for going through the step by step on solving questions in the worksheet, it serves little purpose for people whose answers were all correct. However, this is assuming the tutorial answers are given, work steps may be left out. If students have questions that they just can't seem to figure out how to solve, then they SHOULD attend tutorials to receive tuition.

Other ways a tutorial class can be made more meaningful / useful:

1. A session to help students who struggle even with the least difficult questions --> help weaker students to strengthen their foundation

2. Tutorial-only special questions - special questions that will only be shown and gone through during tutorials (e.g. selected PYP questions) --> might incentivise people to attend to not miss out ""correct answers / methods"" for finals

Some profs think that if students don't attend tutorial and email them or TA for solutions / clarifications, it may result in ineffiency. However, why not explore other solutions like actively making use of discussion board (and profs can ignore the emails and answer whatever that is on the discussion board if they want to)? E.g., if more difficult questions are not covered in depth during tutorials, students can post these questions @ discussion board, and other students can answer. Helps to foster that spirit to help one another in the same course, and students who regularly answer questions for other student can receive their 5 bonus marks instead of people who simply clock attendance and do something else during tutorials...

Agree with those comments who say that the 2 to 5 bonus marks policy is just an easy way out of this absentism issue.

Please consider discontinuing credit transfer of CORE MODULES so that CCDS students with high GPA can‚Äôt exploit this to maintain or ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù their high Year 1 GPA by clearing most of their difficult CORE MODULES later at exchange universities! What‚Äôs so unfair is that these students can even go for two semesters of exchange (GEM Explorer, SUSEP) because of their high GPA while students with low GPA might not even get to go for any exchange and have to complete all their CORE MODULES at NTU CCDS (with their grades received for those modules being computed into their GPA and reflected on their transcript). 

This exploitation is more commonly seen among a group of international students to maintain their high GPA at NTU. They came in with advanced understanding of Programming, Mathematics and Physics, did extremely well in the Year 1 modules (because of their background in those subject areas), and maintained their high GPA throughout the years by going for university exchanges to clear CORE MODULES that are not in their area of strengths. 

NTU students who graduated with a perfect 5.0 GPA should be expected to demonstrate academic competency in their major by scoring ‚ÄôA-grade‚Äô in all core modules, and not because they were able to circumvent some difficult core modules through university exchange programmes.

High GPA students can go exchange all they want if that actually benefit their global exposure and learning, and does not compromise on what one expects of a rigorous degree programme. 

Can you imagine someone graduating from a University with a perfect 5.0 GPA with about half of their core modules being Pass/Fail (completed on exchange/MOOCs) vs. someone graduating from the same University with a slightly less than 5.0 GPA but received A in all of their core modules (completed at their institution). The difference between the two is great. It also reflects poorly on the University for allowing such to happen and places question on whether their degree programme is considered ‚Äúrigorous‚Äù and ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù enough.

My suggestion is just an additional add-on to the recent key changes. You don‚Äôt need to get so angry over it if it doesn‚Äôt affects you. The school can also choose not to accept my suggestion for whatsoever valid reasons. 

Look, what‚Äôs the point of implementing policy changes in the name of fostering academic excellence and academic integrity when there‚Äôs an existing ‚Äùloophole‚Äù that students can exploit to escape from all these efforts of the school in implementing these changes for the better. Imagine encouraging participation, strengthening fair assessment practices, and valuing teaching feedbacks only to have their own high GPA students bypassing these policies by not having to take these modules at NTU CCDS in the first place.

704,Comment,1esugn1,CCDS New Academic Policy (No one asked bruh),theHunteddd,2024-08-16 11:42:59+00:00,"You mentioned that its ‚Äústudied‚Äù that people do worse if taught by online classes. I would love to see the evidence. Additionally, are you SURE that the reason you mentioned is the ONLY, or even MAJOR factor towards a student‚Äôs learning? Taking such a view is extremely narrow-minded, and fails to take into account the plethora of other factors that contributes to ineffective learning. 

Since you seemed to enjoy quoting studies, let me give you some:

1. A clear structure, framework, scaffolding surrounds, supports and informs learning (Baume and Scanlon, 2018). In NTU‚Äôs context, specifically, CCDS, I think many students can attest to how badly some of the courses are structured. Furthermore, ‚Äúscaffolding‚Äù, which in this case refers to sequential learning, is almost non-existent in many of these courses, simply due to the lack of effort (perceived or otherwise) on the bulk majority of the Professors‚Äô part to actually teach. In fact, many of these slides are simply copied wholesale, with some even bearing the source logos (i.e. MIT‚Äôs logo was still present on one of our course slides üíÄüíÄ).

2. Curriculum which addresses big ideas and which gives learners the big picture is most engaging. Coherence for the learner and the ability to make connections in different contexts is also supported. (Watkins et. al., 2002). Once again, NTU fails to provide for both an ‚Äúengaging‚Äù curriculum, and coherence for the learner. I think many can attest to how little effort many profs put into actually ‚Äúteaching‚Äù content, with many either just blindly reading off slides or simply droning on with little effort at engagement. If that is the case, why should students even bother coming down to school? As any good CS student will tell you, optimization is key. And in this case, coming to school for lessons is just simply a suboptimal solution. 

I shall not belabor the point further, but I think you get my drift. In summary, the school has many avenues to improve the learning experience for students, yet it chose a string of policies that negatively impacts most, the most. As mentioned above, there are many straightforward solutions to exponentially improving a students‚Äô learning in NTU - i.e. by making good quality teaching a KPI for Professors, rather than just research impact. Yes, we may have become a ‚ÄúWorld Class‚Äù university, but at what cost?

Also, before you go ahead to blindly defend the school‚Äôs atrocious policies, I think it would be prudent to actually look at things objectively, rather than simply claiming to do so, to avoid the risk of embarrassing yourself. It seems like common sense has been chasing you, just that you‚Äôve always been faster.

To me, it also depends on the exchange university. Are the overseas courses much easier? The course lecturers are supposed to be strict on this. It makes more sense to me to be strict at this gateway instead of restricting clearing cores on exchange.

As to the situation that transcripts show half of cores being P/F, I guess anyone who's serious about the transcripts will ask for the transcripts from the exchange universities. If they do badly overseas, that's bad for them, too. The worry seems to be that their NTU GPA is high -- in that regard, I think what should be controlled is, when considering the honours degrees, the transcripts from the exchange universities must be taken into account.",1,0,,2024,8

There is an AU cap in place for how much you can credit transfer from exchange overall. Calling the exchange system a loophole is quite a crazy cope, especially considering that you do still need to be relatively capable to get into a quality university of your choosing. Your 5.0 GPA student is more likely to pursue exchange in Top Tier Colleges, which themselves have far more limited slots than most of the other colleges offered by GEM. 

Also, you seem to suggest that the ideal NTU top scorer should forgo the opportunity to broaden their horizons with exchange and score all their A/A+ locally, wtf is the point of that? Why would you even incentivise that, when colleges are meant to provide opportunities to open up your worldview and receive a well-rounded education in your preferred discipline. Going overseas to experience the different pedagogies and tutelage of world-renowned professors allows for exactly that.

But about this specific policy, it would be very bad to let this empty class situation carry on. It neither makes the TAs any better, nor improves education.

International freshie here
Sorry for the rant but I do need some advice!

I‚Äôm financially poor (from a single family with lower than $800/mth income) so applied to a bunch of bursaries & study loans. 
Did manage to get a few.( that‚Äôs the main reason why I accepted the offer & matriculated)
For context, it‚Äôs ocbc tuition fee loan & another half-loan half-grant scheme in my home country.

Enrolled into econs without studying econs before. 
My mother was stressing out & struggling because of me . We both cried a lot recently lol.
Especially we‚Äôre currently facing difficulties finding a surety for my tuition grant. If no one can help it‚Äôs gonna be 40k$ per year and we totally won‚Äôt be able to afford it, and I‚Äôll definitely drop out after that,which means I‚Äôll have to pay 20k$ for sem 1 still.

Now stressing about studies& financial difficulties &mental health 

Should I just drop out in teaching week 2 since they wont charge me a full semester of tuition fees? Although I understand some fees may be charged still. It‚Äôs better than slowly crushing my mentality.

Thanks in advance!


update: 
one of my mom‚Äôs friends said they can be a surety, but will need my mom to withdraw her bank savings and open a joint account together with him(total sgd 50000 )

 I don‚Äôt think I should be selfish cuz it‚Äôs almost all of my mom‚Äôs savings. It‚Äôs a big amount.

So currently I‚Äôll be looking for other unis, although it‚Äôs so frustrating that all my efforts became wasted, at least I can study peacefully without big concerns!

Update 2:

If you insist on doing an education outside of Malaysia but have little to no funds, there are options. 

German public universities - choices for english bachelors are few but free even for internationals. Avoid the private ones and be aware that some public ones will charge you. Also try to avoid the big cities, rental is killer out there.

Needs blind universities in America. Unfortunately the universities that offer such aid is limited to the most competitive types like Princeton. But, should you get in, you would get a full ride education.

The last option, which admittedly would be somewhat insane if feasible, would be to do an online masters at CU Boulder. You will be limited to the few options they offer, but, it only costs USD15k for the entire programme and you don't need a bachelors to enter. It is risky though as you won't be admitted unless you pass the first 2 courses which you must pay for.

I don't really have any advice but just thought I'd share my  finances as it's similar situation to yours hopefully it can help you to make a decision.

I also took tuition grant and tuition fee loans as well, but also took the study loan + living allowance loan. My month expenses is around 650SGD(live frugally)and can be funded through the work study scheme if you manage to find a job for 16 hours per week(maximum allowed). Over the summer I did an internship, which converted to part time during the sem which definitely help my expenses( tbh I was lucky to get this internship). The biggest help was definitely the MOE, tuition grant which basically halves the intl tuition fees.

In the end, my parents had to pay around 7k SGD yearly which roughly the equivalent of a private edu in Malaysia( albeit probably on the higher end). But in exchange you are pretty much guarantee a work pass( landing a job is ofc, not guaranteed ) considering you have to serve your bond and more doors opened for your career compared to Malaysia( imo ).

I honestly don't see how you can fund your entire education here purely from bursaries and household income - I did part time work while undergrad, and full time work while doing post grad. It is super expensive even for a local who is receiving subsidies.

Even after getting a NTU degree you'll still have a steep uphill fight as a fresh grad facing essentially unlimited competition for jobs in SG. You have to calculate ahead with that 4-5 year plan in mind.

823,Post,1eueim8,They really couldn't care less,Aromatic-Mousse-1661,2024-08-17 10:25:12+00:00,"It's my first week of being a freshman here but my opinion of this place has already been thoroughly soiled. 

Tried to take an exemption test for SC1003, followed all the instructions, and pretested the website (HackerEarth) the day before (Friday) to make sure I was able to do the test, according to the instructions. The test was an hour long and the window to begin it was also exactly an hour; there was no margin for error. If I found issues, I could've gone home to do it on another laptop since it was on a Saturday (today), but nothing was awry.

FF to the test window, I launch the test, and the website hits me with an error that wasn't accounted for in the pretesting instructions, which prevents me from proceeding. I follow the on-screen troubleshooting from the website but it doesn't work out. So, I immediately e-mail my prof going back and forth trying to troubleshoot the problem, and eventually the window lapses. He then offers to let me do the test in person, so I rush over to the venue.

I get to hardware lab 2 and explain who I am to whom I assume is a lab tech, and he seats me at a desktop to do the test. I start the clock and almost immediately, I have another issue, and so I call on the lab tech. He tries to diagnose the problem (2-3 mins) but gets stuck and calls the prof. It takes him another 5-7 mins to arrive and realize that I was trying to edit the pre-written read-only code within the editor (I had never used HackerEarth before, so I didn't realize), which derails my train of thought. This is especially detrimental to me as I already have trouble with my train of thought, which causes me to have spasms if I don't accommodate for it properly. At this point I'm already very unfocused and annoyed especially at the tone of the professor and the fact that I can't edit that code, but I continue with the test.

The first question goes smoothly (took about 10 mins), but I spend an excessive amount of time on the second question trying to figure out why my program fails on one of the test cases, and so the test ends (ig this means I failed).

While preparing to leave, the lab tech from earlier snarks ""better check your laptop next time"".

(Paraphrasing here)

\[Me\]: Yeah. (My mind's still working on the code lol)

\[Lab tech\]: Looks like you don't know how to use your own laptop.

(I think the prof told him about everything)

\[Me\]: I followed the pretesting instructions yesterday, I didn't find anything wrong.

\[Lab tech\]: Then how come your camera like that? (The problem was with my mac's webcam)

\[Me\]: The instructions said nothing about my camera and I was able to start and finish the practice test. Why wasn't it in the instructions?

\[Lab tech\]: There were 60 students, you are the only one with problem.

\[Me\]: Which means you'll just ignore the issue?

.

.

\[Lab tech\]: You had problem, so the prof and I let you sit this test here.

\[Me\]: So you just want a ""thank you""? You do realize if the instructions were better, I wouldn't be having this problem at all, right?

\[Lab tech\]: I could have just ignored it and let you do SC1003.

\[Me\]: Wow. You really sunk my opinion of NTU just by that line alone, and I've only been here a week. What is your name?

\[Lab tech\]: If you have so much problem here, why don't you study somewhere else?

\[Me\]: Did you really just say ""just don't study at NTU""?

\[Lab tech\]: (Says something but avoids the question)

\[Me\]: No, just tell me, true or false. Did you just say that?

\[Lab tech\]: (Keeps avoiding the question)



I want to escalate this issue, but I don't know how and I don't know who the lab tech is.

I've already been experiencing other issues at NTU like online lectures having 500+ participants, leaving no room for interaction. If the only thing I'm allowed to do is ask one-line questions through Q&A's, why wouldn't I just watch the pre-recorded lectures that we're required to watch and just pose my doubts to chatGPT? I'm really struggling to understand why NTU is so highly ranked.

Then the rest of the event is just two people escalating an argument for no good reason until it gets really unpleasant. This is more like two people walking into each other and neither apologizes, instead of some issue that is a huge stain on NTU as a university.",52,0,,2024,8

This is an exam administered by ntu to determine whether I‚Äôm required to take the mod for the rest of the semester, but is allowed to be delivered in such an unprofessional way by  irresponsible people who are unwilling to deal with actually setting it up. The exam was only announced two days prior, with one e-mail on the day before offering limited instructions and no briefings on the actual test. This gave us all limited time to prepare, but coming from a Java background, I had to learn Python (never coded in python before) in two days because of the short notice. They made no efforts to anticipate any issues, for ample testing, or offer support if they arose, and no margin for error (1 hr test window for a 1hr test).

Anytime sellers request payment in gift cards it's a scam: otherwise why can they just accept your money and use it to buy said gift cards themselves?

Scammers want gift cards because it's a payment that's not traceable and not reversible. 

Also, notice that when you ask questions about the guitar the only answer you received is a bunch of pictures. The pictures are stolen. And the scammer answered this way because he knows nothing about guitars and so cannot actually answer your question",21,0,,2024,8

But would this also create a lot of non-revenue buses taking up road space during peak period?

Eg. When they are travelling from Lee Wee Nam Back to Hall 1

Unless we also split Blue Service into 2 Halves. Blue 1 and Blue 2. Then once Red 1 Service Ends (Lee Wee Nam to Hall 1), the bus would change service to Blue 1 (eg. Hall 6 to NIE Blk 2).

But the second would mean Lee Wee Nam and Hall 1/Hall 4 would become a major ""interchange"" for those who want to ride from (eg. SPMS to Hall 11).",1,0,,2024,8

I'm wondering has it always been the problem since ages? Is the school management aware of it?

Cuz the toilets at my accommodations are ok, at least I don't think there's strong urine smell

It just feels so weird cuz a top uni in Sg cannot properly maintain the toilet cleanliness. I mean I understand it's not related to NTU department, it's more about what a toilet department will do, but if NTU wish to care more, they will care more about it

Back in my day, it's not uncommon to see three ~ five bus 179 all come up in one shot. There's always a seat for everyone. But NTU shuttle buses always has been a problem due to their low frequency and high passenger volume 

Plus I'm sure it's not a money problem. Look at how expensive the tuition fees are, especially for international students. Now multiply that by the hundreds or even thousands of students across different faculties and majors.

You are clearly talking out of point. The topic we are discussing here is not who or what is deciding how much the tuition fees is. We are talking about ***what*** **they are spending on** *after* collecting all those tuition fees. Spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a mouldy building? No problem! Spend a tiny fraction of that amount on more buses and bus drivers to improve the quality of life of students and NTU staff? Nah, not gonna happen.

>But it is likely that when the university was negotiating the current contract with the bus company, it did not anticipate the recent increase in the number of students

I doubt that is the problem. Firstly, the number of students per major is clearly indicated in the NTU IGP as you can see here: [https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/oad2/website\_files/igp/ntu\_igp.pdf](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/oad2/website_files/igp/ntu_igp.pdf)

NTU literally controls the quota for each major intake. So they definitely know exactly how many students they are having in total.

Secondly, if their contract with the existing company is indeed fixed, then why not just hire more bus drivers and more buses from *another* company to meet the new demand? It can't be a money problem as I mentioned above. NTU has a LOT of funds to build expensive buildings, yet refuses to have more internal shuttle buses for both their students and staff?",6,0,,2024,8

Well, I was thinking about master's students instead of just undergraduates. I think MOE has been encouraging the universities (including NUS) to run more master's programmes to increase the revenue because they cannot give that much money that is needed by the universities, which only means that the cost of operating a university is even higher than what has been taken into account in the tuition increase.

I went to stay in a hall with my secondary school friend as roommate, we'd travelled and stayed together before so it wouldn't have been an issue. My roommate said he wasn't gonna go hall orientation because his not that social, not wanting to go alone, didn't go either. In hindsight this shouldn't have been a factor considering I went for my faculty/school orientation where I didn't know anyone either.

1269,Comment,1etw1oa,Singapore's Wooden Building of the Future Has a Mold Problem,qwertygeeky,2024-08-17 02:24:03+00:00,"When the Gaia building at Singapore‚Äôs Nanyang Technological University opened last year, it was heralded as a revolutionary step toward a greener future. The massive structure‚Äî450,000 square feet‚Äîwas constructed from sustainably harvested timber beams and panels. But these days, students and faculty are more focused on an unexpected downside: mold sprouting from all that wood. ‚ÄúIt makes me feel a little grossed out,‚Äù says fourth-year student Grace Ng.

The problem highlights issues that can bedevil timber structures worldwide. While companies from Walmart Inc. to Microsoft Corp. have explored wood as a sustainable construction material, moldy timber in buildings has contributed to sickness, damage and legal battles from London to Melbourne.

Producing materials such as cement and steel is responsible for about 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Trees, by contrast, absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, and when their wood is used in construction, that carbon remains sequestered. The supplier of the wood for the S$125 million ($94 million) Gaia building says the structure stores more than 5,000 tons of CO2, after accounting for shipping.

But what looks good on paper has gotten a reality check in tropical Singapore, where it rains about 180 days a year. The wood in Gaia is primarily Austrian spruce, which was used to manufacture so-called mass-engineered timber‚Äîsuperthin layers glued into panels and beams that can be fashioned into columns, walls, roofs and more.

The Unexpected Downside of Eco-Friendly Wood Buildings: Mold
The trouble is spruce has a lower resistance to mold than many other species. In a place where relative humidity frequently reaches 80%, spruce that‚Äôs not properly treated is vulnerable to mold and rot, says Andrew Wong of the International Wood Culture Society. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically a climate problem,‚Äù Wong says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the tropics, and that requires special attention.‚Äù

But such problems aren‚Äôt confined to the tropics. Desert climates have huge variations in temperature, which can cause excessive expansion and contraction of wood, ultimately cracking it. In subzero climates, water can get into gaps and freeze, splitting timber elements. Engineers must take all of that into account when designing timber buildings, says Erik L‚ÄôHeureux, associate professor of architecture at the National University of Singapore. ‚ÄúThere are limitations and challenges to each climate,‚Äù he says.

Singapore has used mass-engineered timber in 20-plus projects in the past decade, and more than 30 companies there have begun or completed projects with it. Singapore officials, though, haven‚Äôt said whether other buildings are suffering mold problems.

Singapore‚Äôs traditional shophouses.Source: Alamy
Singapore‚Äôs colorful shophouses‚Äîtwo- and three-story colonial-era buildings with ornate plasterwork‚Äîfeature beams made from hardwoods native to the region, which have a natural resistance to mold. But such wood is difficult to find and costs far more today than in the 1900s, when most of the shophouses were built.

Oil palm plantations have replaced many Southeast Asian forests, making chengal‚Äìthe hardwood traditionally used in Singapore‚Äìscarce. And it‚Äôs ideally harvested after about a century, while spruce can reach maturity in a third as long. Hardwood is rarely used in big projects, because ‚Äúit‚Äôs really expensive,‚Äù says Loh Kee Soon, a lead architect for Gaia at RSP Architects Planners & Engineers. To use such timber at scale, ‚Äúyou‚Äôd need a very large forest,‚Äù he says.

While the problems might have been mitigated by thicker protective coating, Loh‚Äôs team rejected that out of cost considerations and because they wanted to highlight the grain of the natural wood. Larch, a softwood with greater resistance to mold, would have been pricier, so Loh used spruce, cladding the columns most exposed to sun and rain with larch.

There‚Äôs little argument about the aesthetic value of Gaia, which houses the university‚Äôs business school. The building‚Äôs 700-foot-long facade curves gently, its interior resembling a giant ski lodge bathed in natural light, with lush gardens tucked into internal courtyards. The ground floor is breezy and open, with no doors at the entrances.

More than a dozen conversations with students and staff who use the building, though, yield disgust, humor and concern about the problem. One staffer says he avoids his office because he‚Äôs afraid the mold will aggravate respiratory issues. ‚ÄúIf the mold is just ugly, it‚Äôs not an issue,‚Äù says student Lifei Shan. ‚ÄúBut since it can cause health problems, the school has to clean it up.‚Äù

Mold expert Joey Feng checks for the presence of mold.Photographer: Ore Huiying/Bloomberg
The first thing visitors see and smell is the fragrant Austrian spruce that makes up the bulk of the building. Joey Feng, a mold inspector from a company called Air & Odor Management, isn‚Äôt impressed. Spotting white flecks that look like dust on a wooden pillar, Feng takes a sample with a swab and dips it into a clear liquid that turns lavender, indicating mold. She later finds more growth on air vents, which risks spreading it through the building. ‚ÄúI would treat this room immediately,‚Äù she says.

The school and architect Loh note that mold isn‚Äôt rare in humid Singapore, and they say it‚Äôs unlikely to affect structural integrity. Nonetheless, the school has developed ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù maintenance plans for Gaia, including reapplying sealant on the timber, adjusting the air-conditioning and asking staff to keep windows closed to reduce condensation. Experts in the field suggest treating surfaces with bleach, applying heavier coatings on the wood, installing dehumidifiers and running the AC 24/7, though that would make the building less sustainable.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of anywhere on Earth you could not use mass timber, if it‚Äôs designed for that particular climate,‚Äù says Art Schmon, an analyst at timber consultant Forest Economic Advisors. ‚ÄúThe disadvantage is that it increases cost. Is it still competitive with steel and concrete? That‚Äôs a separate question.‚Äù",70,0,,2024,8

- But if money isn't an issue, you can consider working odd jobs/ temp jobs/ contract jobs for the next few months then apply for jobs that starts in 2025

Take your time. This is your first job anyway before being a full adult.

They are more inviting than the already saturated business companies and they tend to invite for interviews more readily. That's the thing that comp science grads miss out on too. You do not need to work in a tech centric company. Work in a tech role but in an engineering or manufacturing company. Your role is valuable to the company and it's harder to replace such roles, compared to easily redundant and saturated roles in tech centric companies.",1,0,,2024,8

- Find individuals from companies in sector you are interested in LinkedIn, tell them you're fresh grad and looking to break into the industry. Even if not direct hits, they can help guide you in terms of where to look, how to pitch yourself
- Be nice to HR people but know they're not decisions makers. 
- If you do get an interview, call the interviewer a few days later on your thoughts about the biz. 
- Ask every relative to introduce you to 3 people in their network who might be able to help. 
- Go to industry mixers and meet people. 
- If it's a startup / SME, go in person, say hello and drop off your CV. 

Applying online is the most saturated channel as everyone does it. Of course do it, but explore higher effort job search channels b/c others won't be bothered to even try.

Honestly, the job market isn't as bad as how people perceive, BUT it depends on which industry you wanna head into. Of course, you gotta know that many jobs out there looks at experience more than just a mere degree cert with 1 internship. Also, how you perform in the interview is also quite crucial. Don't over promise but be confident of what you can do. Also, in certain parts of your interview, it doesn't hurt to be a little honest. Afterall, you're a fresh grad, over promising on certain things will kill.

I was looking into the marketing industry/field (but ultimately my current job isn't in marketing üëÄ). There were jobs but they were all sales commissions (no base income). But given the volatility of the economy, this was definitely not a safe choice for starting out.

I feel that in the past, many people will think a gap in your resume may mean you're slacking off. But that's a very stereotypical and dated idea already. Many of us know that the job economy is super bad so I think it is less frowned upon (since it's a common and visible phenomena). When your future employer asks, you can just be frank with them that you have been finding a job. But if you feel uneasy, you can always sign yourself up for Coursera or online courses to upskill yourself (perhaps something you're interested in or the path you are looking to pursue. For marketing students could be like Google Analytics etc etc).

as others have said, most lectures are recorded and you don't have to take attendance unless otherwise stated. course outline and grading criteria usually explicitly stated in first lecture or in materials given online. 

I usually prepare ahead and understood 80-90% of the lecture if the lecturers gave out slides ahead of time. some lectures don't contribute much and can be skipped easily but there are others that are worth going for tho! personally, going for lectures for me serves a few purposes tho..

1. seeing how the lecturer thinks and present these ideas, and comparing it with my own and make a value judgement.  

2. to meet like-minded people, test my active recall, observe where my blindspots are..

3. the slowness allows my head to daydream. leading to asking myself questions, coming up with examples, and forming connections with other things I've learnt throughout the years. esp if it's a topic I'm fairly interested and want to be good at, and there's a clear end-goal for where the lectures are heading towards.",2,0,,2024,8

1417,Post,1expaoq,Petition for NTU students traumatised by campus riders!,humanwaffle2024,2024-08-21 13:12:49+00:00,"Hello everyone, as everyone knows, the campus riders are straight SHIT. So here's a draft petition to hopefully improve the situation.

As students of NTU and/or that are paying school fees, we are rightfully entitled to convenience of transport with the campus riders. However, this is not the case. The bus stops are always full of people waiting for any campus shuttle, eventually potentially needing to give up on going up the bus because people are literally being squashed to the point the bus doors can barely close. The students are then left to watch as bus 179 arrives repeatedly while the bus stop gets even more crowded with people. Moreover, even with continuous feedback there have not been not any actions made to improve the situation of there not being enough buses to ferry the students around. 
Hence, considering the fact that there are students of 2 institutes of higher education that mostly rely on the campus riders to get around school, a suggestion made is to allow NTU & NIE students to ride buses 179 and 199 for free, or at a very discounted rate, through the use of the mateic card. This would allow students to get to their destination more quickly, solve the problem of the insufficient number of campus riders, as well as improve the welfare of the students by not forcing them to squeeze into the buses.",70,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1expaoq/petition_for_ntu_students_traumatised_by_campus/,2024,8

My main gripe is the fact that they purport and tell us that a lot of uni learning is self directed and you gotta pull up your own socks to make the most of the education here but what I had thought of that notion prior to enrolling is that we might have to do some readings, and come to class. What I did NOT expect was for professors for some mods (not all I emphasise) to just drop a youtube playlist link thats like a few years old and for the mod to have basically 0 lectures throughout and expect us to watch the whole thing, complete the tutorial then attend it which happens like once a week like legit dafuq? So you mean to tell me that I'm paying school fees for a goddamn youtube link which means that if I have a senior friend whos taking my course and the same mods he can just drop me the links and I'm basically as educated as he is? Like whats stopping pre tertiary and secondary schools from doing the same thing, recording a lecture once then just throwing the link to all future students till the curriculum changes like I'm sorry didn't I come to what is supossedly one of the best schools in the world to oh I don't know get an education?

One way to go about it is to think of uni as an agent service providing the links to the necessary places and basically planning out your study route. Sure, you could get the link if you had a senior in there, but without a proper learning plan or the materials to apply them in practice, the knowledge will just be dormant and not that useful (said using the mod that I had in mind).

The only obvious benefit this has brought about is that we are now able to view our grades before deciding to Pass/Fail it. However, this applies to BDEs only. Basically no change from what it was in the past, except we can see our grades first before deciding. (In the past, some profs would be nice enough to give u a rough idea of your grade range anyways so this isn‚Äôt really a big thing imo)

MPE-BDEs can be FGO‚Äôd, yes, but it means that the MPE is now considered a BDE. So my BDE requirement count decreases but my MPE one stays the same. If I was taking this module as part of my MPE requirement, I would need to take another module to clear this requirement. 

So essentially, unlike NUS, we still cannot opt to Pass/Fail any core modules at all. Yes it is a small step in the right direction but it feels like this step is way too small. Thoughts? ",62,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/1f31h3v/new_fgo_isnt_actually_as_great_as_it_first_looks/,2024,8

you just gotta try to stay possible as much as possible and get surrounded by people, (you can also reach out for counselling to the school if need to talk it out)
