AMA: Nanyang Business School (NBS),"Hi incoming freshmen, congratulations to those who have successfully (or soon to be) matriculated into the school! 

If you have any questions have about the school, be it regarding academic matters, orientation, hall life, sport CCAs, student clubs, exchange, food, intern, or anything under the moon, feel free to ask away!

I will be answering them from the perspective of an incoming Y2 Business student who took part in almost all of the above, but do take the answers as a pinch of salt as they may not be representative of the entire narrative! üòä

Happy to help anyone enter uni a little more smoothly, feel free to PM me too. Otherwise, have a good last few weeks break before school starts!

 Incoming Y2 as well, just stopping by to say hello Hello! Thank you for posting this AMA! 

Can I ask how do are you selected to join student clubs like the ones related to business? What the application process like and do I need to have certifications/ experience? And also how and when do they begin to accept applications? Would like to know your thoughts ty!! Hi! I am an incoming freshman for NBS and would like to ask the following:

1. Timetable: How is the timetable like, e.g earliest time classes start, frequency of going to school and are lectures online? (i live arnd 1h+ away and not living in hall so wanna see how haha)

2. Orientation: Im aware there's 3 orientation, hall, clubs and faculty. For faculty orientation will it be within your own class? Or will that be for Welcome Day?   

3. Exemption: Im from poly and can exempt from marketing. Can I ask how's the process like? Also, I would like to specialise in Marketing in year 2 (ik its an irony) will there be any disadvantage for me if I exempt from marketing? Thank you for making this place!

I have a question about the NBS curriculum for the first year. How do the first and second semesters go through and what are the tips to get a good score after matriculation? (e.g. preview or read economic magazines...?) Thanks :) Incoming Y3 NBS here.

Freshmens, feel free to ask questions here or DM as well.

See u on campus this Aug :) I'm happy to answer any questions about the Actuarial Science specialisation as a fresh grad! - How is the timetable like? Do you go to school 5 days a week or less?
- How is the workload like, does it feel rushed since it‚Äôs squeezed into three years? not going to nbs but I'm an incoming biz student in 2026 and I wanna ask how are the introverts coping in biz course? Kinda afraid that I won't like it in there as someone who isn't great at talking/presenting in general hi! I‚Äôm an incoming freshman and would like to ask about the rec list for hall selections!

1) for ntu seniors to place me on the rec list, are there any requirements? do they have to be staying in the particular hall that I‚Äôm applying to?
2) how do I increase my chances of getting into the hall that I want via rec list? heard that they look at your talents as well (but not too sure about this) 
3) when is the deadline to submit the rec list? 
4) which hall are u staying at and how is the culture like? which halls do u recommend? I prefer those lively and fun ones
thank you! [deleted] hello! I hope you can give me a little insights on
1. are there a lot of biz students going for overseas exchange or do most students work on internships instead? (considering that there‚Äôs only 3 years and not taking LOA) 

2. when is the best time to go for exchange? (for 3-year degree) 

3. is there a particular exchange program that‚Äôs more competitive? how easy is it to get internships overseas? (I know this is subjective but any input would be nice!)

Thank you!! I know this is a bit weird but I want to ask about calculators. Do we need calculators for business? If yes, what type of calculators do we need? if you are aware, do you mind enlightening me the modules taken by group A and B students in accountancy course? Hi, I just received an email from NBS to register for welcome + orientation programs. However, there is not much information on the website to find some differences (merit?) of orientation programs. Could you briefly explain the activities or vision of each program? Thanks! Hello! Hope you‚Äôre doing well and got to the spec of your choice :) Hello! For business school student clubs, most of them would take in freshmen as sub-committee members, with the exception of some that takes in freshmen as main committee members/ exco members.

If I am not wrong, some clubs require you to go for interview sessions, some require you to do case studies, and some even require to put yourself up for elections for the student body to vote. Each club has their own requirements! 

We have numerous student clubs in NBS and I think they will all have recruitment towards the first few weeks of school! 

To know about recruitment: 
1. Keep a look out during orientation (they shouted out a few clubs during orientation week and welcome day)
2. Keep a look out for your emails
3. Keep a look out for the club‚Äôs social media pages 

The next steps would be to fill up online forms that they set up to know more about yourself (with a couple of role-related questions) and thereafter schedule an interview if needed.

My most important tip If you are interested to join student clubs, is to talk to seniors who are involved in them! Most will be trying to sell you the good things about their clubs and make you really attracted to it, but don‚Äôt close your doors to the other opportunities and amazing clubs there are as well! 

Let me know if this helps :) Hello!

1. Timetable for Y1 students are pre-set, so all the timings and everything are allocated to you. Earliest class time is 830am, and latest class will end by 630pm. Some people get 1-2 days off if they are lucky, think if you were from poly this would be familiar to you! However, during Week 1 and 2, we have this thing called add-drop period. You can log in to NTU Stars and see if there are any slots in the classes of your preferred timings! If you don‚Äôt stay and hall and wish to come school less often, you can try your luck to see if you can cluster your classes together into a few days. Though whether this is a good move also depends, because some modules have lots of presentation and assignments, and it might be too much for one to handle if the assignments and presentations are due to happen on the same day.

2. For faculty orientation, you will not be with your classmates. Everyone will be mixed, so expect to mingle around with everyone from NBS, they may be from Business, Accounting, or from the double degree programme. Same for Welcome Day. Unfortunately, there aren‚Äôt any avenues for you to meet your classmates until class time. There will only be a few familiar faces (say less than 10) that will be in the same class as you for all the modules. 

3. Nope no disadvantage at all! For specialisation wise, each specialisation has a requirement for students, and for marketing the requirement is to get B for Marketing module and C+ for Statistics module. I have a few friends who were exempted from Marketing like you and still got into the Marketing specialisation, so no worries on that. To exempt from marketing, there is a portal that you have to go in and submit your exemption request before a certain date. The notice that your exemption request is successful or not should come in during or by the first two weeks of school, so don‚Äôt be too alarmed if your timetable still has the module allocated! If anything, drop the school an email to clarify :)

Hope this helps! Hello! Let me try to answer with whatever I know, not sure if anything will change for your year though (unlikely).

NBS students will be split into two groups (because there are just too many students in the school), we call them Group A and Group B. Whichever group you get is really dependent on your luck, you don‚Äôt get to choose. Oh you don‚Äôt get to choose which module to take in that semester too! Everything is pre-set.

In Semester 1, Group A students will take modules from the Group A basket. This set of modules are definitely more mathematics/ calculation related, with less project work, so if you are someone who does well in this aspect, try your best to score during this semester! This group of modules consists of:  
- Financial Management (two presentations and one closed book final paper)
- Python (two projects and one final paper with cheat sheet)
- Financial Accounting (one presentation and one closed book final paper)
- Economics (two quizzes and one closed book final paper
- CC1 (tldr it‚Äôs an essay writing and presentation module, quite a few components)
- CC2 (tldr it‚Äôs a module to intro you to tech, quite a few components)

Group B students will take modules from the Group B basket, this set of modules are less heavy on mathematics and calculation, and rather heavy on project works. If you‚Äôre someone who does well in projects and design thinking related stuff, this is the semester for you to score. This group of modules consists of:
- Organisational Behavior (many project and presentations, no final paper)
- Marketing (many project and presentations, no final paper)
- Business Law (one presentation and one open book final paper)
- Statistics (one project and two quizzes with cheat sheet) 
- CC3 (aka ethics, one presentation and one quiz)
- ML4 (a module for problem solving and innovation iirc, one main presentation and many other components)

After Semester 1 ends, you will basically take the other basket of modules you didn‚Äôt take yet. Try to know your strength and weaknesses and aim to score well for the modules you are good at. Every week, you are required to do up your self-learning, readings and tutorials. Maybe your time management would be better than mine but there will come to a point where you are unable to catch up with all these weekly tasks, just because there are so many submissions and assignments to rush for. Don‚Äôt worry too much about it, because many students tend to only rush everything towards the few weeks nearing exam week.

Most importantly! Have fun and have a life and don‚Äôt focus only on academics. This is the last few years to enjoy and fool around before you enter the workforce full-time. You only have six semesters, and each semester is only about 4-5 months long. This is something I am working on myself too but I really hope everyone enjoy their time in uni with their friends rather than cooping in the room mugging away! Cheers :) What did u choose to Spec in? As a JC student who took H2 Math but did not take further Math, do you think it would be a disadvantage? And also are there are a lot of presentations required of actuarial science students. Lastly relative to A levels how hard are the exemption exams? Hello! Timetable is really random and dependent on your luck eh.. I have a few friends who got allocated to only 3 days of classes, and some friends who got allocated to 5 days of classes with morning lessons. You may refer to the first point [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/hQNtA2oTAp) to know more about timetable!

Expect your workload to be heavy towards the later part of the semester‚Ä¶ Projects/ assignments/ presentations/ etc usually are due within the same few weeks, and you have to prepare for them beforehand. Last minute works too if you‚Äôre good at that. On top of these, you still have your weekly readings and tutorials to do, where some are mandatory and tracked. But you‚Äôll sooner or later you‚Äôll find how to work your way around managing your time and prioritising your workload (if you have the resources and materials from your seniors or friends). 

Definitely I would say NBS isn‚Äôt as tough and heavy as other degrees, first few weeks of the semester is rather light and manageable in fact! Things will start to pick up after recess week, so do keep a lookout for that and pace yourself.

Let me know if you have any other questions! You will pickup those skills at NBS. Dw:) I am one and I am doing fine. Just that I am a hall ghost and keep to myself most of the time hahaha Hello! Don‚Äôt worry too much about it, not everyone is born a good speaker. My advice to you now is that even though you‚Äôre an introvert, don‚Äôt close yourself up and shut down the opportunities for you to meet and talk to new people! Definitely as time pass by, you‚Äôll get better as you‚Äôre exposed to more and more of such opportunities. 

As of what I have seen in this past one year in uni, not everyone in NBS speaks well, everyone‚Äôs presentation skill differ. Some are excellent while some fall short in comparison to the former. But nothing to worry, we all get better as time passes :) Hello!

1. This really depends on the hall you are applying to, different hall has different requirements! If the senior rec-ing you is someone of power/ influence in the hall of course he/ she would be able to slot you in easily! I don‚Äôt think there is a requirement per se that he/ she has to stay in the hall in order to rec you. Does your senior know the JCRC team in the hall you‚Äôre interested in? If yes then there‚Äôs a pretty good chance he/ she can help you :)

2. Again, different halls have different requirements. Of course your talent and your skills would be a huge plus point, from dancing, to singing, to sports, to even your intention to join the JCRC team, anything can be used as a brownie point for yourself. Some halls are less popular than others, and the freshie rec list may not be filled up, so as long as you apply you stand a pretty good chance to enter!

3. Every hall differs, but the period to apply is now. Some of the deadlines are as early as 9 June. Do ask around whoever you for the forms or look up the hall‚Äôs IG pages or Tele channels for the rec list. 

4. Every hall is lively and fun if you choose to make it lively and fun. Depends on your definition! Maybe you can share what you envision your hall life to be hahah (like wholesome kind of fun or drinking partying kind of fun). Do you want the fun and liveliness to be with a group of friends, or do you want it to be an entire hall of fun and liveliness? There are many listicles out there on Reddit and TikTok that share about the different hall cultures, you can take those as a reference. If you have any specific halls in mind, feel free to ask! Hello! This depends on what kind of portfolio you would like to build. 

Are you looking at growing professionally ie. building skills related to your prospective career? If this is the case, it‚Äôll be good to expose yourself to the professional clubs where they will have you more or less equipped with skills related to your career. There are clubs that specialise in consulting, investment banking, corporate banking, etc. They have rigorous trainings and competitions that teaches you related skills and background of the respective industries.  

Or are you looking at enhancing your soft skills like leadership and event planning? If this is the case, you can consider joining student clubs where they host and organise events for the student body. Certain roles also allow you to reach out to external vendors to find potential partnerships and sponsorships, so this may be a way to network too!

Or you can consider both too if you like, just be sure that you are able to cope with the workload (if you‚Äôre interested to know about workload let me know) and you don‚Äôt ghost one for the other because that will only reflect badly on yourself. Hope this helps :) Hello! Here‚Äôs my personal opinion based on what I have seen, take it with a pinch of salt!

1. I think compared to other courses, the % of Business students going exchange is higher. That being said, there is a good mix of people who choose to i) go for exchange, ii) stay in SG to continue their studies normally,  and iii) take LOA for internship. It‚Äôs normal for students to go on semestral exchange and still graduate within 3 years! That is how our school curriculum is set.

2. There isn‚Äôt any best time to go for exchange, but your choices are only Y2S1, Y2S2, and Y3S1. Depending on your personal preference tbh. I think they don‚Äôt allow students to go for semestral exchange on their last semester which is Y3S1! Securing an exchange spot is dependent on the demand and your GPA, so what most students do is to apply for Y2 exchange in Y1 and see if they can make it. If they can‚Äôt, apply again in Y2 for Y3 and pray that your new GPA makes the cut.

3. We have three kinds of exchange, Winter being 1-2 months, Summer being 2-3 months, and Semestral being 5-6 months. I would say the longer the exchange is the higher the demand. Some countries are also more popular than others, eg. Korea, Europe, etc. Some universities are also more popular than others! Oh also, each university has a certain limit to the number of students they can take, so the lower the number, the more competitive it is. For a gauge, some universities are only allowing 3 NBS students, why some allow 20 NBS students. Really dependent on the university you choose. 

Securing an internship overseas is not rare, there are cases of it happening! If you want this overseas internship to be credit bearing, there are some requirements that the company has to meet before it can be counted as credit bearing. Honestly I am not too sure about overseas internship so if anyone has experience with it feel free to chime in!

Hope this helps! :) Hello! Yes we do use the normal scientific calculator (eg. Casio or Sharp) kind, as well as a financial calculator. If you don‚Äôt have any of those, no rush as you can purchase it over the first few weeks in school or hand-me-downs from your seniors :) Hello! Unfortunately am not too sure about the specifics of Accountancy, but as long as you are matriculated into the school already you should be able to access the NTU student intranet :) From there, search up NBS Curriculum and click around you‚Äôll be able to find it! Hello! I will try my best to explain with my existing knowledge: 

- NBS FOP, Rush, Zenith have similar concept, typical camp activities in your groups and as a whole camp.
- Colour Splash is same as above but has a trademark colour run/ flour bash kinda concept.
- Infla has more of a professional outlook, with activities such as company visits/ industry talk etc.

Depends on what you‚Äôre looking for! Just a slight note that you can‚Äôt expect all the camp activities to be fun, go in with an open mind, if you manage to make a group of friends you can goof around together, any games will be fun if you make it to be :) Yeah I did thanks for asking! [deleted] thank u so much! ! This is super informative :) I‚Äôll keep an eye out for emails. Thanks for taking the time to respond! This is so detailed omg rlly appreciate it! Oh another helpful tip would be to attend orientation so you can interact seniors and make more friends, even if you‚Äôre an introvert. Most of the time there will be resources and materials passed down!

For most projects, trust me, you‚Äôll be either too lost or clueless where to start. You can learn from their experiences and take a look at the projects that they have done as a reference to get yourself kickstarted on the projects! 

You can‚Äôt imagine the amount of resources and notes that will be circulating around, and sadly those who don‚Äôt have these are only on the losing end‚Ä¶ Beware of plagiarism though! The school is very strict on this matter. This is very helpful! Thank you! Mkg I won't sugarcoat things: it will probably be a steeper learning curve without Further Maths, especially given that there isn't probability & statistics in H2 Maths. But nothing you cannot overcome, since you will be taking AB1202 Statistics and Analysis in your first year. That said, it's not taught very rigorously, so some self-studying of BA2203 Statistical Modelling may be wise. (In fact, the best course of action would be to take MH2500 in your first semester, but of course NBS doesn't allow students to take electives in Y1.)

Presentations ‚Äî most core business and ICC mods will have one or two presentations. Actuarial science mods will also typically have one, but it will not be overly technical or marked primarily on presentation skills, but rather on the content itself. You should not fear presentations. Actuaries are primarily businesspeople who happen to know a little bit of mathematics and statistics; their most important work comes from communicating decision-critical information to both technical and nontechnical audiences.

It's hard to compare between A-levels and the final exams for the actuarial core mods. They take place in totally different contexts, and place different demands on students. Sorry I can't really give you much more info than that. I would say that one should not worry too much about the relative difficulty of one's course of study. Instead, study what you will enjoy the most, and everything else will come naturally. (How to go about finding what exactly you enjoy is a different question altogether.) Thank you for the detailed answer! thanks so much! Thank you so much, this is really helpful!! Thanks! Gotta find my scientific calculator then (idk where i threw it after As) Ohhh I didn‚Äôt know that! Thank you for pointing out this distinction, it‚Äôs very helpful :) NBS CCA fair's gonna be held on 15 & 16 Aug!¬† OMG Thank you so much for your kind response! 

I heard there are some requirements for specific subjects before choosing my specialization before entering sophomore. Could you briefly explain how his system works and some minimum requirements for each specialization? Thanks! Hi! How is marketing as a specialisation? Is it more presentation based and is it difficult to score in NBS? Omg Tysm!! I will be attending!! üòÜüòÜüòÜüòÜ Hello! Here are the requirements, towards the end of Y1 they will send an email with all of the details so you can catch the details again then :)
- Banking and Finance, International Trading: B+ for Financial Management
- Marketing: B for Marketing and C+ for Statistics
- Risk Analytics: B for Statistics
- Business Analytics: B+ for Statistics
- Actuarial Science: B+ for Statistics
- Human Resource: B for Organisational Behaviour

If you do meet the requirements for the specialisation you stand a good chance to get in the specialisation of your choice. Otherwise, you may have to appeal for the spec you want. Marketing is pretty chill.

It is presentation and reports based but then also it's comparatively easy flowing because there are no finals. ahh i see, understand. Thankyou!"
Academic Termination,"I just got my results. My previous 2 sem was done badly and my GPA was below 2. 
This sem is worked and passed all my courses however I was not able to pull up my CGPA above 2.
Therefore I got Academic Termination. I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO :(. I want to just finish my degree but I don‚Äôt know how to get out of the termination. Can I appeal? If yes how do I appeal? And usually does the appeal work? 
PLEASE HELP:( The worst day in my life‚Ä¶
 From the student handbook:

‚Äú Students with poor results will be accorded the following academic standing and subjected to performance review:  Academic Warning ‚Äì if the CGPA falls below 2.00 for any given semester.  Academic Probation ‚Äì if the CGPA falls below 2.00 for the second consecutive semester.  Academic Termination ‚Äì if the CGPA falls below 2.00 for the 3rd consecutive semester, or at the end of the final semester of study. A letter of termination will be issued. Appeal against termination on the grounds of extenuating circumstances may be made, subject to the following rules: -The appeal must be submitted to the relevant School within 2 weeks after the release of the semester examination results or before the start of the next semester, whichever is earlier. -Only one appeal is allowed per candidature. ‚Äú

You must be panicking so hard right now. I really feel your pain. Try your best and exhaust all means! Don‚Äôt give up just yet ‚ù§Ô∏è All the best sir Appeals work! Try sending it to the undergrad office, they'll know what to do. They usually only give one chance, on very rare occasions two if your GPA is very close to 2. You'll need to submit your timetable to the office or to your mentor for approval, and they'll make you sit through all peer tutoring sessions for your mods. Just curious, what's your major Hello! I can sympathise with you because i was once in your shoes in Y1. But due to COVID i somehow manage to pull up my grades because finals was cancelled and they took the average from CAs. So i consider myself lucky (also EEE) Now i have graduated. What i did was to speak with the academic counsellor. They should be available to advise you on how to craft your appeal, what you should work on etc. as well as generally on your mental health. Hope things work out for you. Hang in there! Do bookmark the [student intranet](https://entuedu.sharepoint.com/sites/student) if you haven't.

hello OP, was in a similar position a few sems ago and the article above encouraged me to continue going on. Jiayou, take the chance to appeal, don't give up <3 Write an email to the dean of your school, that‚Äôs the best thing you can do for now. Thank you so much for these. I‚Äôm panicking since the results came out. Faced some tough times personally last 2 sems. Not sure if I‚Äôll be accepted back :( Thanks buddy. But the thing I don‚Äôt know what to do haha Also please don't write to the dean, check in with the undergrad office to know who to send the appeal to. Could be the associate chair (students) but I'm not too sure. EEE :( Thank you! Appreciate your words:) Have spoken to the councillor. Shall see where it goes Thank you so much! :) Thank you. Any suggestions on what I can write :( Are you seeing a psychiatrist for the tough times? 

If you are not, are you able to see one ASAP? I believe NTU had one when I was there but i don‚Äôt know if they still have one, appointments take some time to get. Better for you to go for a private clinic appt now if you are able to get the funds to do so. 

Psychiatrists are able to diagnose you and write an official letter for you to explain your mental health diagnosis and situation. This official letter will likely be accepted as extenuating circumstances. 

And of course your appeal should also mention how you are currently coping, your improvement for this sem and how you plan to continue to pull up your GPA.

Please speak to your student well-being person ASAP as they will be able to advise you far better than we can. Best of luck, sorry to hear that you‚Äôre having tough times. Hope you can finish your degree. If it‚Äôs something you don‚Äôt mind sharing, should list it in the appeal letter to help your case. Sorry to hear what happened to you, was quite surprise as I was on AW for 3 sems myself back in the day

Might help if you can find a few friends or even a prof to write in good words for you too. Else can ask the admin staff monitoring you for AW (if this practice is still in use) what you can do or how to appeal. Do it asap Hii! Thank you for the suggestions. I have reached out to the Student well being person. Let‚Äôs see what she suggest. Finger crossed Are u direct 2 yr Well... you could always consult ChatGPT to help you write a letter that suits your needs!  Granted - you'll probably still need to edit its output afterwards, but it's a start? Ah yo yo! Such a personal thing also need people to teach you how to write.  You got to do something for yourself than to ask for help Thank you so much for the kind words! I'm worried for myself too Thank you for the suggestion. Appreciate it really surprised you think the way you do What‚Äôs there to be surprised? Don‚Äôt try to act a saint.  If one can‚Äôt even write a personal thing, what can he do in life?  Always depend on others for help?"
Advice to freshers ,"This post is for freshmen joining this year! Congratulations on getting accepted! It's a great accomplishment and frankly, you should be proud of it.üíØüåü

So, I'm from ADM, currently going to y3, I've been in around 6 CCA clubs and participated in multiple events, so you can say I'm quite involved as a person when it comes to campus life. Here's my advice as a senior, to everyone who are feeling nervous about starting uni life!

1) **Be not afraid** : Starting uni is so nerve-wracking. You are gonna be overwhelmed by a whole new system, Group projects, orientation etc etc. It's only natural, to feel nervous and believe you might not do as well as you expected. The thing about uni life, especially in year 1, is that it's rigorous and tries to introduce you to challenges all at once but the key to getting over it, is to 
- Seek support from fellow peers and instructors 
- Take breaks , constantly stressing over academics will leave a bad taste even after accomplishing goals and cause burnout 
- Make use of resources, the study spaces, the convenient food options, events that give you freebies, just try to integrate and assimilate with the environment.
- Try to find people who share similar interests as you and join clubs that appeal to you as well 

2) **Ask** : Don't be hesitant when it comes to asking questions about courses. This app is really good when it comes to answering very specific questions about the mods. Feel free to ask your instructors to help you out, there's even a CommsCube to help you out with assignments and stuff and don't shy away from using these things because these are all there for your own benefit 
https://www.ntu.edu.sg/lcc/about-us/lcc-communication-cube

3) **Don't overdo** : We all wanna outshine and be the best. But there's a fine line with doing everything and getting extremely exhausted and burnt out from work. Don't join too many CCA's, stick to one or two per year. Try not to overload everything at once, it is seriously not worth it. There should be room for self reflection and enjoyment and one shouldn't limit themselves to just uni life. Hang out with friends, read books, travel and taking that time off, really inspires even more creativity and thinking. 


4) **Health is wealth** : Most overused sentence but the amount of people who started pulling all nighters after joining uni is concerning. Hey, if you pull all nighter one day please atleast catch up on it the next day. Don't leave things for last minute or if U do, prioritise things that are due more earlier or important. Sleep is important and eating healthy is too. Don't stick to just fast foods or instant food. There's even some healthy options at convenience stores and supermarkets now. Take care , not just of Ur physical health but also your mental health.

Lastly, do attend all the career events, cultural and art events (usually at North spine ) and hey, NTU FEST is coming back this August and it's gonna be filled with fun and multiple activities for you guys to enjoy so do come !!


**What apps should you install?**

1) NTU OMNIBUS : Good for checking bus timings , usually updated 
2) Cates ; Ordering food from eateries 
3) Intellect : NTU has partnership with this app and all students get free access to premium materials and can even book sessions with counsellors. 
4) Canva : Good for presentations, collaborating with people (you can use your NTU email for education purposes)
5) Notion : Good for organising purposes (NTU also has tieups with this )

Fellow Seniors, feel free to drop your advice to freshers!


Key advice ? Make the best out of it. You're paying so much, make use of every resource out there and don't pass on any opportunity.üí•
 From a nervous freshie: thank u for taking the time to write out this post ü´∂ People use cates? Hi! Fellow senior here :) i agree with what the senior here said! Uni can be a scary but fun experience! Dont be afraid to reach out, ask your classmates to lunch or go to events! Who knows the person right beside you could just be feeling the same nervousness as you! Thanks for the helpful advice! 
Can I ask what is Notion used for? and what is the NTU tie-up with them? Thank you!! üôè Hihi just wanna ask about your opinion about FOC. I‚Äôm lowkey quite anxious/ reluctant about joining FOC cuz of the long duration and the overview given sounds boring (I‚Äôm sorry but yes 

I‚Äôve read multiple threads and a lot of them said it‚Äôs extremely important and most of their friends are from FOC so yeah‚Ä¶. Do you have like a lot of parties here ?? Does hall count as one cca? Yea some do! Notion's basically an organisation tool for you to plan and track stuff, including school work! I'm not sure how best to explain it, but there's a lot of YouTube videos explaining how to use it and how different people set it up for their own use. 

Basically the ntu tie-in is that if you sign up for an account with your ntu email, you're able to upgrade to an education plan for free and access some features that would usually require a paid subscription. I think it's a great space and a good opportunity to meet people! I unfortunately missed mine when I was in year 1 but when I facilitated it for my juniors, I realised how engaging and fun it can be and how it can help connect people together. Plus you get all sorts of free goodies and stuff so I highly recommend! Like simply staying in hall? Don't think so. Thanks for reply and sharing! Will check it out :) aites thankewwwww"
Aight I‚Äôm bored let‚Äôs stir the pot," Ah yes

Primarily an engineer problem Thought experiment. Does badly for A levels, goes into a dumping ground degree programme, will hate the major for all 4 years, and ICC is actually a relief and a salve... Then does badly for ICC. As someone whose cc mods pulled up my gpa, you are absolutely right. But I‚Äôll take all the W I can get What is Cc mod To be honest, I think it should be allowed to S/U. Let people decide if they want it to be included in their grades. Not everybody is good at writing reports and what not--believe me, I have to correct my own teammates work all the time because they either use random sources that aren't credible at all, etc. I just don't see the value in forcing people to take CC mods and stress unnecessarily over them. I just hate ICCs pulling down my GPA (no offence) [deleted] Shots fired Random idea: If I can get a 4.5 GPA, I can switch major. (with the help of ICC) NUS can s/u their cc mod equivalents sia why we cannot, so dumb fr CC mods are pulling my gpa down, shit is preventing me from getting FCH Erm there's also another option you know? BOTH your course mods and ICC mods pull up your gpa. Not a conducive discussion because you cannot benchmark people just by ‚Äúgetting good at your major‚Äù if you are not aware of the standards and difficulty level each course sets. 

Maybe for some courses most of the mods have mean grade of B+, whereas for other courses most mods have mean grade of B or B-. [deleted] Discuss (5 marks) An absolute nightmare Damn how low does your gpa have to be to say this

(I am being crass, my gpa is 2.5 and I am on academic warning) Time spent on CC mods should be used for major instead. ü§ì I didn't learn anything useful for CC1. Yes. 

5 marks. Ah so this shitposter is actually ntu enginger 

ü§£ü§£ü§£ Isn‚Äôt academic warning for <2.0? Yeah CC1 to me is probably the most useless CC mod, what tf am I gonna do with learning how to write an op-ed lmao üíÄ [deleted] Someone didn‚Äôt do well for CC1 Look at my username

That‚Äôs all the proof you need Idk have never been on academic warning use it to write forum letters to ST As a soci student, CC1 is simple and takes very little time

üòÇüòÇüòÇ you would think engineering doesn't have enough presentation but I had this mod and I think other branches do called Engineers in Society and I had to present 3 times throughout for 2AU. It was a group presentation so that's a bonus compared to CC1 Individual presentation. 

This mod also challenged us to prepare ourselves for the presentation 2 days before the presentation day because of procrastination and my team members who don't meet much manage to make it work. 

Scored A-. Sorli

An NTU student‚Äôs letter to Singapore‚Äôs Ministry of Home Affairs," How is that Home affairs problem, shouldn't they write to Foreign affairs? whats ntu gonna do ![gif](giphy|VIPfTy8y1Lc5iREYDS|downsized)

What bro imagined themselves as when writing this ü§£ü§£ü§£ Just curious, how is SG complicit? When you can't get an internship during this vacation and do woke shxt like this I mean I love the sentiment but honestly what is he/she is trying to achieve. We are a small country with limited influence on global events. Definitely my heart goes out to Palestine but honestly what can we do? Also personally isn‚Äôt there like worse/cruel genocides that are currently ongoing. Like maybe Yemeni crisis, Rohingya , Uyghurs. Why is there a disparity in media attention. This is my personal opinion btw. üëÄ I‚Äôm pretty sure NTU is just waiting for E to get charged as grounds to expel E. Problematic student causing problems from the school level to the union level. I say this as a student from the same home school.

A quick search on LinkedIn shows that E received some most inspiring youth award from a political party in Singapore. Either the bar is set so low or E was the only eligible recipient lol.

Also, NTU SSS should seriously reconsider its decision to employ E as a student ambassador. ""fellows students"" 

""growing knowledge for good""

Bruh There is no university in Sudan too. Bunch of hypocrites shit LOL Whether Gaza still has universities or not is not even a consideration for MHA to come up with this. Those woke students are just making links to Gaza just to find something to protest over Throwaway for obvious reasons

The person who wrote the letter is an FA. 

I‚Äôll leave it here. Send him there Aiya conscript him again and send him there then Send them to Gaza to rebuild the schools Can expel this student? Really a bunch of clowns throw NTU face. Did the writer write in for Ukraine, too? Those people writing all these letters are just superficial, write until like this then enjoy their own life like no other business at home. This person DEFINITELY read SG's foreign policy and all those stuffs SG definitely will be in better position to poke our noses in big country shenenigans /s Brainrot they want ntu to build a campus there ? What is it about MRHA that they're against? It's just GAZA GAZA GAZA in the pic Nothing better to do.  He is not gonna to change the world or the world is not gonna change for him. So many things she should prioritize over Gaza problem, like aging issue, climate change, Ukraine, AI killing humankind etc‚Ä¶ 
Get your priorities right. I don't quite get the point of the letter, i mean what much can Singapore do? We can't afford to have enemies. If you really want things to be done, maybe find a way to write to a more powerful country.

Also, don't get me wrong. I am outraged with what's happening in the war. So many innocent lives lost, and it is not right in any way. But, why isn't anyone talking about the civil war in Sudan or in Myanmar, which is next to us? People are dying and suffering there too. what's with the negative comments attacking the writer for speaking up for an issue they believe in through official channels

it's ok if you dont care about gaza, maybe as students or interns we might be dealing with too much to afford mental energy to care, but what's the deal with insulting people who are trying to speak their mind, and aren't doing anything to harm you? Stay woke, stay broke Oh well A lot of people in this thread need to take a class on logic 101. An individual being vocal about the palestinian cause does not entail that they are unsympathetic to other causes concerning crimes against humanity (e.g. what‚Äôs happening in syria, yemen, rohingya, china etc.). If you pitiful lot think a little, you‚Äôd see that there are several reasons why more attention is given to the palestinian cause over these other causes, not least because the genocide in palestine is overwhelmingly well-documented and publicised at the present moment. We literally have daily mass-transmitted reports with visual evidence of civilians being killed by israel. And given, among other things, 1) the rate and scope of israeli attacks against palestinians (refugee camps, hospitals, schools destroyed & entire bloodlines wiped out daily), 2) the *explicit* (i.e. public) pronouncement to flatten gaza by israeli officials, and 3) the *explicit* disregard for international law by israel, it is understandable why the palestinian cause seems to demand a relatively greater urgency over other causes right now.

In any case, you pitiful lot reveal yourselves to be lowly cowards who are quick to anger at proponents of justice but slow to anger at criminals committing genocide. You attempt to veil your moral bankruptcy with your whataboutisms, thinking we wouldn‚Äôt see through your pretensions to pragmatism & so-called fairness. Just say you‚Äôre spineless and move on. Oh. I remember when I was young and thought shit like this would make a difference. 

Nope. It‚Äôs all for yourself, and to let your friends know that you‚Äôre part of the ‚Äútribe‚Äù. They don't care about our own Singaporeans and want to care for people so far away. woke kids if care so much please buy a one way ticket to GAZA and actually do something fking idiot thinks that the government live under the rock, really wonder how he is in one of the best universities in singapore Complicit in what lol. We're in a diff position as opposed to the U.S sending arms to Israel. No job for you after you graduate. Who gives a FK

Bloody extremists ruined Gaza Shan-Ge should just send this Jabroni to the gulags Is Gaza a country? At least some of our students have a conscience why not just go over to gaza and help?? As someone who graduated from NTU and made some great friends but thought most of the student body was pathetic, apolitical and cared only about themselves, this thread seems to prove that's mostly the kind of person NTU seems to attract. This one from NTU or NTUC? If Singapore provide resources to Israel whether directly or indirectly, therefore we are complicit in this genocie. Orh. No HaMas in West Bank ? Please easily find out online ‚Ä¶.. Today I learned that Intelligence without Wisdom is like a ship without a compass, directionless and potentially dangerous It's about the edits of the Maintenance of Racial Harmony bill terrorist sympathizers arent that bright its abt the racial bill Or MOE‚Äôs problem‚Ä¶since no more uni for them to enrol inü§≠ü§≠ü§≠ become Ntuc set up a university there Expel those students s @e.ntu.edu.sg üó£üó£üó£‚ÄºÔ∏è bro is NOT hamilton I really dunno, we got give necessities to palestinians Supposedly the matador that was developed with them is used in the war. nothing to do with Singapore.  It‚Äôs a monkey see monkey do situation.  Elijah Tan is just copying what type of protests trending in USA right now. They‚Äôll get an internship at wake up sg alright probably because this genocide isn‚Äôt as uniformly condemned or even acknowledged as one by everyone(the status quo) unlike the others you mentioned. Just look at the comments to this post ü§∑ Got learn differentiation in school or not? the dy/dx of dead people in Gaza is a bit too high compared to rohingya and uighurs. The FA part shows E is actually a sellout. Yeah, what about the talking point here: Gaza? There must be some justification for expelling him as well. What will be your justification? I am very curious to know. Yeah taking pictures of yourself marching to MHA, deliberately making it a very public stunt and knowing it will make national news, but not even bothering to proofread and rushing the actual content of the letter is truly something else. Like I want to give the benefit of the doubt that it isn‚Äôt performative, but people put more care and effort into their resumes or even a normal everyday email, and I barely expect my own resume to be read. No content and no follow-through but lots of publicity, maybe the person who wrote it should do marketing lol.

Edit: another comment said the writer is an FA, I can‚Äôt imagine a more suitable occupation tbh Source: I made the f up. That's what your education taught U? Whatzzat? Lmao what.

It‚Äôs no longer trendy. Nah, that topic no longer garners enough social media attention, which is the purpose of their little crusade.  Same reason why they don't mention the **actual** genocide in places like China and Myanmar either.

Virtue signallers do not give a shit about the cause. Half of them can't even answer basic questions on the topic. They do it to garner attention and act morally superior. [removed] Who care about Ukraine ? Our biggest enemy is not that ex-USSR leading country that trying to take over the world again but those Islamic world biggest enemy - THE JEWS When your oil price rise, your problem will become ""gaza"" problem My dude. The ""Gaza problem"" is a ""climate change"" and ""AI killing human kind"" problem. Most of us just thinks its weird, we got plenty of issues in our own country already, why aren't we doing a march for those instead?¬†


Also what can we even do for Gaza? We already sent resources. Send in our army? Kinda wild if we are sending ourselves and our families to die to missile strikes to enjoy a moral high ground. And even the moral high ground is kinda debatable, taking either sides in a genociding Muslims vs genociding Jews situation is wild.¬†


Just like Ukraine and Russia, the best thing we can do is sit from afar help in humanitarian terms, which we are already doing, because one of the sides fighting can also nuke us if they end up being left with nothing to lose and finds us annoying enough¬† well, I don't see how what they're doing is going to help. if they really want to speak their mind and actually help Gaza, they could donate, or go volunteer in gaza or something.

and I do think it will harm me indirectly, sooner or later. tbh, I'm scared to have Singapore take a side and have to fight, I don't want our people stirring shit up. do we have the military power to back it up if we take the side of the underdog? maybe, maybe not, but that would one day plunge all our men into danger, our economy into ruin, etc. don't forget how physically small Singapore actually is. do I think the war is needless? yeah, I think it's stupid actually, all wars are. but I'm not sure that Singapore can do anything about it.

does this make me a coward? maybe. but I said what I said. Yea exactly I like how they accuse the writer of bring ""jobless"" when they come and cry abt it in this thread while being terminally online. exactly bruhh Language of the text maybe? Also, the youth are not that liberal. I think you just described singaporean redditors in general. This üíØ Because it‚Äôs uninhabitable. That‚Äôs the point Self centred people. We talking about political stuff and they talking about internship and jobs. If u care about global matters. Provide some thoughts and prayers to the other genocides too. Not just gaza. Ukraine. Sudan. Myanmar- Rohingya. Congratulations, you just figured out economic globalisation. Hamas is everywhere. For them, it's a resistance to occupation, not matter how ugly it looks. you don‚Äôt seem to be that bright yourself cant care dying children and genocide without support terrorists right? I loled don't they have equal rights to use it though? it's not like we're donating matadors to them. can anyone elaborate on why the matador thing is such an huge issue *checks notes*

Hmmm they've been using it since the 2008-2009 Gaza War Bros gonna sign up for ntuc internship at this point Sg gov got condemn about uyghurs? ? For the amount of ordnance dropped, its far lower than any other urban conflict. 

Think u need to learn differentiation. Dy/dx of deaths vs qty of strikes/arty used. You will be surprised to learn that the death toll in Gaza does not near the ones that I have mentioned. In fact that Yemeni crisis is the biggest crisis to date. That‚Äôs with the assumption that the numbers are actually accurate and not drastically inflated to fool terrorist sympathisers like you. Another hot take: FA is NOT an occupation Financial Advisor. so he can live along with them since he care for them so much might as well personally experience what they are going through That should be an act of god.

Oh geeeeeee i wonder which one pay the bills and student loans, after graduating I will take over the role of the breadwinner of the household, pay the bills, and pay my student loans. I don't have the privilege of being an activist which itself is a finacial burden.

ME IS PATHETIC!!!!!! i have reported your account to the ISD hotline for radicalization and the support and admiration of extremist groups. Sounds like you side with radical religious fanatics that murder and rape unprovoked, then celebrate in the streets while parading the corpses of the people they murdered.



Sounds like you are condemning the victims of this murder and rape for fighting back. ¬†those citizens were the ones that voted the terrorists into power. many of the citizens were filmed CHEERING DEATHS AND PARADING DEAD CORPSES IN OCTOBER 7TH.¬†¬† Some people in the populace would not like it if they are made aware that the weapons developed are used for this war. But the point of developing weapons is in case of war though. Let's say 40000 have been killed so far ( not accounted for people trapped inside building rubbles or mass graves or severely injured). Out of this 40000 around 26000 are women and children. So 14000 are all man. Conflict is around 7 months. 40000/ (7*30) = 190/day. Pretty sure it is abnormally high for any conflict happening right now, unless or otherwise you provide me with another rate that exceeds 190 killings per day. This makes the war in Ukraine look like a cakewalk. There is a reason why they call it a genocide and not a war. Just out of curiosity, may I know what is your major? And you know why people support Palestinians? It's because of this   https://youtu.be/MQ1TAOibLss?si=A7qpjwRRetRjcoc5

Btw the documentary is made by Israel to recall old hard days when they had to ""struggle"" to occupy Palestine. Emphasis on dy/dx. I hope you know what that means. I did some calculations with a troll down in the comment section to show why Gaza is on the news. The numbers are Verified by UN and used by IDF*. Unless you are one of those people that buy into fox news theory of calling UN Hamas. A bit too far fetched to call UN terrorist? Can't believe a fox news watcher is on this thread. What's your next comment? Donald trump for 2025? Earth is flat? Moon landing is fake? Oic You're really telling him to go to get bombed and die with them because he cares about them? Act of God? Let me ask you what is more likely. That [13000+](https://www.savethechildren.net/news/over-2-gaza-s-child-population-killed-or-injured-six-months-war) dead children have been killed acts of God, or that the National Security Minister, Ben Gvir, is carrying out his [""voluntary emigration""](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.timesofisrael.com/ben-gvir-calls-to-encourage-emigration-resettle-gaza-at-ultra-nationalist-rally/amp/), [as promised.](https://truthout.org/articles/top-israeli-official-calls-for-israeli-settlement-of-gaza-in-chilling-remarks/) Wrong thread. I am not interested in your internship or your job. Neither your employers are with that attitude. Sorry to reveal it to you. First time Reddit user, oh so scary! Report the other ones too quick! Self radicals ! Ah yes a 40 beheaded baby believer. Not very bright indeed. did u accidentally describe urself FYI, the last election held in Gaza was in 2006. Considering the Palestinian population is quite young, most of them haven‚Äôt had the chance to vote for their leader. Not really. What about the West Bank? No Hamas there. The citizens cheered because they thought they would be free from the soldiers that were keeping them as prisoners. Google the worlds largest open air prison. 
Deathtoll in ukraine is already higher than 190 a day. 

Casualties there are likely 1k/day at least when you include both sides. So thats ~300 deaths a day there for 1:2-3 ratio. Russian deaths in Ukraine are likely higher than the conventional 1:3 ratio since they just spam meat assaults. At least try not to use data that is easily disprovable :) 

Unfortunately, revealing major is too much for a throwaway. Stop typing now...quickly fly to Palestine and join their army.

Then you can type. What‚Äôs parentheses there for? Besides, I don‚Äôt actually think that UN is a hamas organisation or any other strawman you have attempted to use against me. Considering how incompetent, malicious and disorganised hamas is, there is no way that they are able to provide accurate numbers to account for their casualties of this conflict. In fact, it would be advantageous for them to inflate these numbers to play victim when they escalated this conflict on 7/10. ‚ÄúUN verified these numbers‚Äù, how? Did they actually count it? Did they verify the identities of those corpses or did they just provide the numbers given by hamas?

The numbers provided by hamas are dubious at best. A detailed trending and study by a statistician highlighted inconsistencies with it. If you want to, you can take a read here: https://fathomjournal.org/statistically-impossible-a-critical-analysis-of-hamass-women-and-children-casualty-figures/ With that being said I think ur also like him you should join him there if u actually care so much about them don‚Äôt be pretentious yes, you care so much about them IDC ABOUT THOSE CHILDREN PLS a Shani Louk video believer. poor woman was killed and paraded in the streets by celebrating terrorists. 

  
I didnt talk about any babies in any of my comments, seems that it's terrorist supporters like you love to spread misinformation. Lmao typical. When you guys have nothing left to defend your terror loving fanatism, you fall back to whataboutism and ""no u"".¬†


Come back when you have an actual response. How do you ensure that future generations can vote? Prisons house criminals. So a fitting name. Not only that many non hamas citizens crossed into israel to kill There is one thing to lie as if you are speaking facts and there is another where you just plainly bs. Are you from NTU? 

The death toll in Ukraine is around 11000. The war has been going on for around 2.5 years. Calculate it yourself. 

For Ukraine at least there is Start and end date. For Palestine we are just accounting for whatever happened after Oct 7 with moderate numbers. Before Oct 7 is as truly horrible as after Oct 7. 

Let numbers speak for themselves.

https://www.statista.com/topics/9087/russia-ukraine-war-2022/#topicOverview ""Join their army and then? Which army? Which location ? Is there even an airport in Gaza? Quick instruct me more, I am waiting!"" Stupid idiot. Okay, I'm pretentious. Why should I go to Gaza when Israel openly admits to identifying humanitarian workers as Hamas and then killing them?

The articles I posted was not by Hamas, it was by Reuters.

No matter what my personal character is, no matter how pretentious or disgusting I am, the facts I've presented still lie before you, and you have not countered any of the articles. No one asked you comment either, if you don't care. Then what is your thought on this that went on and on before Oct 7. I am really curious to know. How can a Palestinian respond to this? No troll answer pls. You can view the full Israeli documentary on youtube. https://youtu.be/MQ1TAOibLss?si=ds5x0RuYsA3qmlU9 now say that to the children there Actually the current Ukraine death toll to my knowledge is 444000.

https://preview.redd.it/oq8q3uesr66d1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bb6e99ebdc107cff7ec1ed524f39388861d278d2 Who stated the war first Hamas pulled off a sneak attack on Israel with no warning or what not and after realising they can‚Äôt win they hide behind their citizens like meat shield if any Hamas is to be blame stop acting like Hamas is all rightly and good yeah no. you have already shown in your last comment that you are willing to twist facts, misinterpret and outright lie about others' comments. 

without even an apology, you then try to extract more comments, expecting a 'troll answer'.

not that i'm surprised. that's the terrorist gameplan after all, to lie and misconstrue. Have you tried not using emotional manipulation to bring across your point? Or are your claims so baseless you need to rely on emotions to sway those who disagree with you?  ""Civilians"" should be the category. Not military. CIVILIANS. WOMEN and CHILDREN. That's how you calculate death toll and show on the news, not military death toll. If it's military, you can pretty much call every war a genocide. Even the war against nazi. Killing Nazis = Nazi genocide? History did not start on October 7. Even if it did, what gives Israel the right to bomb humanitarian vehicles when the humanitarian organization IDENTIFIED THEIR ROUTE AND VEHICLE BEFOREHAND? That's a troll comment. I didn't twist any facts. You have to point me where I twisted facts. Don't accuse people of something that you yourself do. If you can't answer honestly just don't comment. It's like debating with a flat earther, always in constant denial, very annoying. I believe when it comes to death tolls there isn‚Äôt a differentiation from military personnel and civilians. Since lives are quite equal when it comes to death statistics. Also one side has predominantly volunteers (those part of NGOs and military organisations). So the history did gave right to Palestinian to kill & torture who ever they want on 7 Oct?  Bro , you are not woke enough , go sleep Your whataboutism strong. Answer his question, who started the war with an unprovoked attack in October?


If Malaysia attacks Singapore, make no mistake we will hit back with everything we got, and more. Technological superiority and the threat of paying back violence 10 fold and has always been the game plan for small nations surrounded by enemies. Israel is the angry bear the terrorists should not have poked awake. That's not how it is counted. They are classified as civilians which is verified by UN. You want to believe or not is totally up to you. But IDF use this number in their official military planning. Even if you exclude all the man or in this case the  ""military"" as per the very trusty Israelis (not verified by any international organisation), the death toll of children and women alone is around 26000 in 7 months. That's like 123 people killed/day. Compared to 11000/(2*365), around 15 killed per day. I think we can just all agree both sides (the perpetrators of the attacks) just hate each other? [deleted] Well according to the UN Genocide convention; 

Any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

(a) Killing members of the group;

(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;

(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;

(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.

Doesn‚Äôt differentiate one of military/sex/gender. But broadly talks about people being in a particular area. 

Importantly, the victims of genocide are deliberately targeted - not randomly ‚Äì because of their real or perceived membership of one of the four groups protected under the Convention. This means that the target of destruction must be the group, as such, and not its members as individuals. Genocide can also be committed against only a part of the group, as long as that part is identifiable (including within a geographically limited area) and ‚Äúsubstantial.‚Äù

I‚Äôve added the link here for perusal: https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/genocide.shtml They did hate each other , I have so much reason why Palestine is not a 100% victim here . Lmao declaring a LITERAL UNPROVOKED TERROR ACT as ""leading a military operation that lasted hours"".¬†¬†


Plain and simple, you are a terrorist supporter.


I rest my case. Doing my part as a citizen to report this radicalism to ISD So why isn't there a ""Nazi genocide""? ""Soviet genocide""? 

>Doesn‚Äôt differentiate one of military/sex/gender. But broadly talks about people being in a particular area. 

Because this made up point doesn't exist in the convention.

The genocide convention was made because of the holocaust. Jews were killed in concentration camps, not Nazi military personnels.

 But the rest of the points do apply to 40000 dead people in Gaza. That is why there is a genocide case in ICJ against Israel and not against Palestinians. I think it‚Äôs better to narrow it down to the civilians or Palestinian Civilians. Because when people say Palestine a lot of people may misinterpret it as the Hamas Al-Qassam Brigades (The Hamas military wing who planned and executed the 7th october attacks, killed Isreali civilians and kidnapped the hostages) . I guess Ukraine invaded Russia then, since all Russia did was a Special Military Operation.

Cognitive dissonance of some people are unreal. [deleted] I‚Äôm not following u with the nazi genocide part. I know that 17 million or more Jews were killed. And the number of nazis that were killed don‚Äôt come to memory. Well since most probably they would have been killed by the allied forces. But majority of the facist nations believers have gone underground. Specifically they went towards Latin America. I‚Äôm positively sure that there are less nazi soldiers dead when it comes to Jews deaths. Both of them I will say , maybe many of you don‚Äôt know . The day after the Re‚Äôim massacre, many Palestinian in Gaza and other country celebrate for the massacre . They are more cruel than the IDF , specially if you saw the photo of the Re‚Äôim victims. (dm me if you want to see the photos) 

https://www.youtube.com/live/fjsPvJyVit0?si=MMpqqvsOcKo4GHSU (this is a live podcast on 9Oct at Sydney) The IDF should stop bombing Gaza for now, I hope this will be the last warning for those extremist Islamic country that acting like an animal will be treated like an animal. This will also let the Europe nations and Australia know it's better to stop receiving these uneducated religious extremists. Russia attacked Ukraine. Ukraine punched back with the backing of the entire West.

casus belli in action. You talk alot but fail to cover that in international relations, an unprovoked invasion and massacre of a neighbouring country is a declaration of war. Ok let's not talk about Nazis becoming victim of genocide then (which btw fulfills all the criteria of genocide because of your made up point). Let's talk about something specific, the Slavs (which includes Russians, Serbs, Bosnians). Around 9 million Slavs were killed (when they were trying to save the Jews from Nazis) vs 6 million jews killed by nazis. This will mean there was a slav genocide because of your made up point.

We are not even talking about civilian rate of kills at this point. 190 kills per day for civilian category is insane even for world war 2 standards. This is what Gaza is experiencing. I just want to emphasise this. Such hearsay

The 3 day SMO was so successful that Ukraine is now invading the Russian territories of Zaporizhe?, Luhansk, Donetsk, and Kherson.

Another angle of the bus," Sometimes i see like 2-3 smrt buses on 179 route with no number / training busses. And im like wtf. They drivers trying to clock in time but not fetch people isit? I once lodged a complaint for one time the 179 took 45 mins to come around 6-7pm during my exams. 
 
Though waiting for 45mins for a public bus is bs. The school has to deploy it's robot buses. NTU has them ! What mrt bus? You mean smrt? They are training their drivers how to drive the 179 route because they will takeover sbs for 179 service. They are taking over from 1 Sept..haven‚Äôt start service lah. Moreover, some training bus doesn‚Äôt even have fare collection equipments"
At the risk of sounding like a broken record: how is it that tourists are still an issue in ntu ,"I thought this was an issue of last semester but I was surprised to see whole groups of students + families with young kids walking around the school today. I went to ss food court and 1/4 of the people were not students and were instead made up of tourists

Like, I genuinely thought the issue of tourists was taken care of. Did you guys also notice a lot of tourists today?  Pre Covid had tourists too. The Hive is a zoo oh yea i saw them. they legit had 3 whole months to do so. why now? Have to compete with them for the shuttle bus too When I was queuing up for the campus bus today, I saw 2 tourists trying to board the 179 bus to go to NTU. However, they were told by the bus driver to go and queue for our campus bus, instead of going over to the other side to board the bus going to the correct direction. Can someone explain to me why there are tourists at NTU? I genuinely don‚Äôt understand. Not like the university is some centuries-old birthplace of literature or something. Graduated but went back to NTU recently in early August to take pics in graduation gown at the Hive. Got harrassed by tourists asking questions about enrollment and filming us without consent‚Äîthis was all the way at Level 3 too :/ I don't envy students who are still in NTU. At least my cohort got shielded from the plague of tourists by er, a different plague (Covid). I don't think NTU will do anything unless local news media makes a circus of it and risks their reputation. because school administration and campus security don‚Äôt care r/NUS also brought up the tourist infestation issue as well. Seem like the measures by both universities were not effective in curbing the infestation [removed] wait so many of them are like 12 üò≠üò≠üò≠ how are touring a uni alr why not secondary sch Have you seen tourists sneaking into lectures before? Campus visits are popular overseas. So don't read too much into it folks. And we are the animals... July and August are the summer holidays in China. The semester starts in September. Obviously not fair. Campus bus should only be tapped by student id. Sabo... Solid sbs uncle No choice. Singapore is lacking in attractions. They've already driven the chinese unis (qinghua, beida etc) to close their gates. This is an issue for domestic tourism too. Your post or comment has violated one of the rules of this subreddit.

The whole frikin blue and red line have only 2 buses during peak hours? Wtf the fees are so expensive but they couldn't manage the bus and the toilets especially 

I literally couldn't hop into the buses for two times in a row lmao

But they are willing to spend $S100 million to build  Gaia building with high quality timber woods but ended up turning into a moldy building. There's a ton of news coverage on this lol

Just why? I don't understand. It's just bizarre that they are willing to spend that much money on a building rather than allocating some of the budgets to improve the school's facilities for the students 

--Frustration from a freshman

https://mothership.sg/2024/08/ntu-gaia-building-mould/ thinking about it. Bus  is the lowest hanging fruit to improve student live.
just 2 more buses running at busy time, one for red, one for blue. Logistically, i dont think it can be that hard.

There are better ways to cut cost for ntu other than bus I like how you type op, very interesting üî•üî•üî•üî• It‚Äôs really terrible. I‚Äôve been coping by just walking to my classes lol I‚Äôd rather sweat than tahan peak hour bus ü•≤ Has been an issue, and NTUSU can‚Äôt see it ü§≠

But typically here‚Äôs the peak period, incase you drive to school. 

Campus Loop :
- 0800 to 1030 (Current: 5 buses. You need 5-6 buses)
- 1200 to 1430 (Current: 2-5 buses. You need 4-5 buses) 
- 1700 to 1830(except Fri 1700 to 1800) (Current: 2buses. You need 4-5 buses) 

Campus Rider : 
- The usual 
- 2000 to 2230 (Bring back 3 buses lah) 

Facilities wise :
- Set up another resting point for drivers behind NIE, so they can take longer breaks if they do not need to charge their bus. Can start a new trip from LWN instead.
- Install freaking EV charger at the bus park if it‚Äôs not done. It‚Äôs a shame that NUS could do this at their PGP terminal but not NTU. 
- Overhead Bridge/Sheltered crossing? Hello? 
- Stop pampering your staff with coach buses(more seats). The 10pm bus is still packed like sardines. If the system can't handle the load this late at night it must have been awful at 5... Today was bad. Waited for like 45 mins Apparently the email stating that they will increase bus frequencies is a scam. Just. Get. More. Buses. If NTU can spend money to build a moldy building, getting more bus drivers should be a piece of cake. Can't get more bus drivers? Then get a frigging double decker bus. Can't do that? Then bike sharing. We need solutions nowwww

Lmaooo Well this has been a problem for quite a while already idk y they have not improved the timings yet after so much negative feedback (at least they did change the bus model to the current one with more standing space like sbs/smrt buses, a year ago most of the campus buses were still like those tour/school buses with mostly seats, and u can imagine how much harder it is to squeeze into those, many had to stand on the narrow aisle in the middle)

CCDS New Academic Policy (No one asked bruh)," I think many prof had a concern of no people turning up for tutorial/lecture, so they had to do this LOL. last sem had this mod i think the prof express his concern multiple time, even warn to not give any recording/answers if the attendance is less than 10 pax. https://preview.redd.it/5myea853ztid1.jpeg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8808b7d70fcdba92f56832f07a8b01a35df55943

SCSE is officially better than CCDS üò° It's even worse for students who live on the other side of sg(unable to afford hall), and have to make their way to that one tutorial in the middle of the day with no other classes. Will someone be starting some sort of petition if enough people are displeased with this new Tutorial Policy? Bruh the bonus marks 5% is such a meritocracy problem. People who dont stay hall or dont find the tut worth going. I feel we should just boycott the survey and rate every course 0/5 during the 7th week and 14 week. If CCDS wants to improve tutorial attendence rates, rather than artificially inflating its value by giving out undeserved free points, they should make tutorials actually attractive to attend.

Giving free points for tutorial attendence only exacerbates inequality without any overall improvement in teaching standards. How does participation mark even work? Does the professors actually give a damn about us? I'm dubious about this participation bonus mark system. 1) Voiding Course retention is basically rendering tapau useless. For those who are genuinely sick, that would be a giant middle finger to all their efforts in their semester.

2) The core problem with tutorials is that it doesn‚Äôt value add. Most people that I see that go for tutorials mainly hang around for 1-2 week to see whether the TAs are good in explaining, however in most cases the TAs can barely even converse in English before asking u the golden ‚Äú‰Ω†‰ºöËØ¥‰∏≠ÊñáÂêóÔºü‚Äù to explain. Even so, most of them just simply read off from slides which you can do as well in your free time.

3) Now talking about the add on 5 marks, Tutorial rooms are notoriously small, assuming that everyone goes , do u think that the room can fit all the CCDS people? And would be become like NBS where ‚ÄúGood Morning TA‚Äù counts towards class participation that‚Äôs so rampant in business courses? Would students ask weird / straight up dumb questions for the sake of getting the class part? In NBS fighting for class part creates an extremely toxic environment already which I think CCDS would be better off without. Biggest issue here is the attendance taking IMO. The TAs fail to adequately value-add in most cases, and I think most people would rather go through the provided solutions in their own time, allowing for a flexible schedule.

Personally, I only ever did STARS with lab timings in mind, and I then went for back-to-back tutorials where the TAs are known to be more competent, allowing me to go for all my relevant classes within 1 - 2 days. This new change just makes it harder for driven students to seek good TAs.

Don‚Äôt see how this does any good aside from increasing administrative overhead and more headache for everyone. The whole point of make-up quizzes is to allow sick people or people with other valid LOA reasons such as family member death, international competitions to focus on what they‚Äôre doing (recuperating, participating and practising), not to study. Making the make-up quizzes harder only hurts those who have a valid reason to take LOA. This is stupid. There changes benefit mostly hall students(who are able to afford the fees of renting + food) and academically poor students. To the students who are impacted by this new tutorial policy (those living far away especially) *write emails* to revert back or maybe introduce online tutorials! I know some TA‚Äôs even prefer it My timetable is so bad. Just one tutorial for the whole day, on 2 different days. 

I‚Äôm still gonna attend tutorials by crashing other classes and not my allocated index. They should at the very least reward us as well right [https://chng.it/5phBygVCZ5](https://chng.it/5phBygVCZ5) 

  
Just putting the petition here \^ ngl fr why they even added this tutorial attendance. Haven‚Äôt even attended a single tutorial for years and i just did my STARS without caring about the tut slot n focused on my lab slot timings bruh I think it really depends on the purpose of the tutorial. Interesting read here: https://cte-blog.uwaterloo.ca/why-do-some-students-choose-not-attend-the-tutorials-walid-omran-international-ta-developer/

While there are competent TAs and Profs (though not all) conducting tutorials, if most tutorials are just a session for going through the step by step on solving questions in the worksheet, it serves little purpose for people whose answers were all correct. However, this is assuming the tutorial answers are given, work steps may be left out. If students have questions that they just can't seem to figure out how to solve, then they SHOULD attend tutorials to receive tuition.

Other ways a tutorial class can be made more meaningful / useful:

1. A session to help students who struggle even with the least difficult questions --> help weaker students to strengthen their foundation

2. Tutorial-only special questions - special questions that will only be shown and gone through during tutorials (e.g. selected PYP questions) --> might incentivise people to attend to not miss out ""correct answers / methods"" for finals

Some profs think that if students don't attend tutorial and email them or TA for solutions / clarifications, it may result in ineffiency. However, why not explore other solutions like actively making use of discussion board (and profs can ignore the emails and answer whatever that is on the discussion board if they want to)? E.g., if more difficult questions are not covered in depth during tutorials, students can post these questions @ discussion board, and other students can answer. Helps to foster that spirit to help one another in the same course, and students who regularly answer questions for other student can receive their 5 bonus marks instead of people who simply clock attendance and do something else during tutorials...

Agree with those comments who say that the 2 to 5 bonus marks policy is just an easy way out of this absentism issue.

Inserting a controversial opinion here, i much rather attend cc mods tutorial. the content of the mod is disgusting but at least there are things to do during tutorial (like group discussions, consultations w prof, presentations etc.) I pushed all my schedule into 2 days. I already have a business so I will just skip those classes (lectures and tutorials) on the other 3 days since my business is worth the grade loss. OP start petition to revert changes let's just say i hope the TAs will be bros Let‚Äôs suggest another change to add to the existing key changes so that NTU uphold the highest level of academic integrity and standard in Singapore!

Please consider discontinuing credit transfer of CORE MODULES so that CCDS students with high GPA can‚Äôt exploit this to maintain or ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù their high Year 1 GPA by clearing most of their difficult CORE MODULES later at exchange universities! What‚Äôs so unfair is that these students can even go for two semesters of exchange (GEM Explorer, SUSEP) because of their high GPA while students with low GPA might not even get to go for any exchange and have to complete all their CORE MODULES at NTU CCDS (with their grades received for those modules being computed into their GPA and reflected on their transcript). 

This exploitation is more commonly seen among a group of international students to maintain their high GPA at NTU. They came in with advanced understanding of Programming, Mathematics and Physics, did extremely well in the Year 1 modules (because of their background in those subject areas), and maintained their high GPA throughout the years by going for university exchanges to clear CORE MODULES that are not in their area of strengths. 

NTU students who graduated with a perfect 5.0 GPA should be expected to demonstrate academic competency in their major by scoring ‚ÄôA-grade‚Äô in all core modules, and not because they were able to circumvent some difficult core modules through university exchange programmes. 

What do you guys think of this suggestion? Yay or Nay? ccds is producing new Soviet Joke in 21th century! Those complainers here who are secretly doing internship during term time studies better  'fess up No more watching lecture in 2x speed ü•≤ [deleted] Rip L prof University shouldn't really have compulsory attendance. Students are adults, and should be responsible for themselves. If they don't study (in a proper way) and fail, just let them fail. Are you from CCDS? If you are, you should know that you are hurting yourself. No rational person would damage their own brand. Well they will still not go lol I live in the East too and it took me more than an hour and a half to go to NTU, so I sympathize. But there's a much higher order potential loss here. Professor student engagement is the fundamental, basic interaction of a good university. That knowledge transfer, often intangible/unwritten, is what is extremely important. It builds culture, knowledge, know how etc. And it is what sets a real university apart from a Coursera module. I actually might lol, maybe I will make another post (prob a poll) in this subreddit on some alternate changes and what actions to take if the petition is successful and see whether people are open to it. It will be too late by then, we need to make changes and revert back within a week. If this gets delayed then students who went for tutorials will complain they did not get bonus points making it unfair for them. Exactly this I believe it‚Äôs CCDS‚Äôs priority to make tutorials attractive to attend. But we need to attend tutorials to support their efforts! Yea it is indeed pretty sus We don‚Äôt need to have to either. CCDS is a science/engineering college where we learn the technical stuff unlike business students who have to dress up fancy and actively market themselves (like a business). CCDS should be , you understand this concept? You can solve the problems? Can you actually think and solve new problems with pre existing concepts? Can you come up with a better more efficient solution?Done [deleted] 1. To be fair, virtually all cases of tapau I've seen people do was to exploit the system. 

2/3. Is a right step towards student - professor engagement. Yes students, especially CCDS ones, aren't going to like it. But the higher purpose of learning and engagement is fulfilled by it. Teaching quality is a separate issue, you both can't actually improve professors if no one goes to their classes, nor should you scrap tutorials (which is effectively what happens a lot) because a few are bad at teaching. 

  
I think you're exaggerating the class part thing a lot. A mild class part like in the Ethnics course is harmless. Just reply when the teacher asks a question. And you can just book a bigger room. Personally I've never been in a tutorial that's beyond max capacity. >  in most cases the TAs can barely even converse in English

I thought CCDS wants faculty members to teach tutorials and PhD students are not allowed to teach tutorials?

> Tutorial rooms are notoriously small, assuming that everyone goes , do u think that the room can fit all the CCDS people? 

They never assign more students to a tutorial room than its capacity. > that would be a giant middle finger to all their efforts in their semester. 

If they are genuinely sick, they have learnt the material and they will have an advantage in the second round when they retake the course. Yep exactly, they are basically removing our freedom now as we can no longer do things our own way now Yea makes things even more unfair Yep, even then some academically poor students might be unable to attend tutorials themselves too (they might even have part time jobs during school time too) and instead simply email profs just like some of us, making the policy even worse for them as well \^ I hope so too,my timetable is arguably much worse but this I can do. Still not full freedom but is a valid midpoint maintaining both the interests of the school and students. They really should add special concessions for students staying out of hall given that hall is (somewhat pricey / filled) Yea exactly man, profs clearly forget some people don't live in hall at all. Now that you mention it, it might be a good idea to remove tutorial indexes and instead allow us to attend any available tutorial session, with all the recorded names being collated every week. This can apply to online sessions as well if they are open to that. Wdyt about this idea? but if your name is not even in that index and the tutor can't see it then how he mark your attendance [deleted] [deleted] Because direct, physical engagement is necessary to create a lively, vibrant learning environment. It doesn't guarantee it, but it is necessary. CCDS is at the state where it's basically an 90% online course. I remember at my OS tutorial just me and one other person would attend. In my embedded lectures six people would attend. It was really bad. I actually might lol, maybe I will make another post (prob a poll) in this subreddit on some alternate changes and what actions to take if the petition is successful and see whether people are open to it. Lol if all TAs are based and cultured homies that we all can hang out with, I actually wouldn't mind Hmm I think this will definitely make things fairer (which is why I believe GPA isn't 100% skill based due to rng groups, profs, hax etc), what I think they could do instead is remove the exchange advantage, however not only drastically increase the amount of SU credits, but also allow Core mods and MPEs (maybe even ICC) to be SU as well. This would basically grant almost the same exchange advantage, but to all students instead (IMO it's not worth it to spend so much money to go to exchange JUST to SU mods anyways, there has to be more reasons for it to be worth). Wdyt about this idea? This is a total skill issue, there‚Äôs nothing unfair about maximising the benefits you get from a system for doing well. If you want to go for two exchanges to a University of your choice, do better for your modules. The only thing that‚Äôs unfair about this is that more people don‚Äôt know that they can do this before it‚Äôs too late. > They came in with advanced understanding of Programming, Mathematics and Physics, did extremely well in the Year 1 modules (because of their background in those subject areas), and maintained their high GPA 

What is this? Jealousy because others are better at the subjects? from my observation good students generally get A/A+ at difficult core modules that others struggle in. its the fluff mod that they do poorly in. in which case, exchange or not doesnt matter (unless they clear fluff mods during exchange lol but uk CCDS dont have fluff mods either) :) How competitive applying for exchange is? Is the oversea university gonna accept a students who rarely takes hard modules? The internship would provide them infinitely more value than that extra grade. Most of the people complaining are people who sleep in the whole summer break and only have their gpa to talk about. The people grinding internships during school period are probably the high fliers and don't even care lol, they just go from an A+ to an A or A- One good news is that attendance of lec is still not considered No This comment is not even wrong. Hi how can a prof like yourself say this? [deleted] Yes, but they will be at an unfair disadvantage in terms of actual marks. I never needed to go tutorials for DSA or Linear Algebra and still performed well. I used that time to study myself, while saving on transportation costs and the enormous amount of travel time used up to attend that one tutorial. This is really disadvantageous to those residing in far of areas such as myself. While I agree that student professor interaction is important. I already had that before this policy was announced. I actively interacted with TA‚Äôs and proffesor‚Äôs outside of tutorials and improved my understanding of the concepts. In any case this student-proffesor interaction cannot come at the cost of grades and a students finances! If they wanted better student engagement, why not optimise timetables so classes of the same school can be packed in one day, allow students to attend class and interact via zoom, stop hiring tutors and professors who are horrible at teaching, and hire better tutors and lecturers? Simply forcing students to attend class is not solving the root problem. Not everyone has the same needs and this is university, not high school. No need to chase after people for attendance and homework. [deleted] If exams are the primary way knowledge and skillsets are measured then this is taking an enormous amount of time from studying. This is an enormous handicap for those not staying in halls. I know this cause my planning of the schedule has helped me achieve really great grades in the past semester compared to the first semester as a freshman . Think third class to first class honours. It is the bad quality of tutorial that makes students prefer coursera/MIT open course rather than CCDS's tutorial [deleted] Tapau is when a mod has finals, U take MC for exam thus the grade is not reflected in your transcript. But with course retention marks you are able to ""Preserve"" whatever assignments u did in the Dabaoed Module, thus lightening your workload for the next semester, u just need to take finals. BUT without course retention, u need to do everything from scratch. They've made changes that are inconvenient. Not bad for education. It's studied that people do worse if taught by online classes than physically in college. I agree with your change of the carry over system, but the tutorials policy is really hurting people unnecessarily. Good points! If you have never been to a tutorial beyond it's max capacity, then you have never had the pleasure of being to qi Kun's discrete math tutorial classes :D

Man's a legend, extremely passionate teacher who hand writes his answers and breakdown concepts extremely well 

I had to go to his classroom earlier because so many people were there, even at the final weeks. Students were sitting on the floor because there were no chairs left Hi habibi, ur comments are giving all the CCDS students brain damage. I doubt u are even a CCDS let alone a NTU student based on ur comment history. If you‚Äôre a student, you would be able to empathise with students who stay extremely far. The fact that u have no idea how many TAs that can barely converse in English is teaching in NTU is evidence that you are not even from this uni [deleted] I also signed up for NTU instead of SMU for exactly this reason. Had I known, I wouldn‚Äôt have accepted this offer. Yeap totally agreed with you. I have emailed them regarding this, maybe you can feedback to them too. Since they love to hear feedbacks from students, this sounds like a reasonable request to ask for and act on [deleted] The tutor from the class I crash can check my matri card and mark my name down. Then key into the system. That‚Äôs the very least they should allow us to do if they are forcing us to attend tutorials isn‚Äôt it Hi I‚Äôm trying to gather more signatories before emailing the CCDS president From the email it seems like it's just attendance, nothing more Yeah the tutor could just make a note. They did it for Ethics. And many other mods. It's not exactly some impossible challenge to take class part. I would be fine with the changes if they implemented it before course registration, but such changes 1 week into the semester is quite unreasonable. Oh, don‚Äôt get mistaken. High GPA students can go exchange all they want if that actually benefit their global exposure and learning, and does not compromise on what one expects of a rigorous degree programme. 

Can you imagine someone graduating from a University with a perfect 5.0 GPA with about half of their core modules being Pass/Fail (completed on exchange/MOOCs) vs. someone graduating from the same University with a slightly less than 5.0 GPA but received A in all of their core modules (completed at their institution). The difference between the two is great. It also reflects poorly on the University for allowing such to happen and places question on whether their degree programme is considered ‚Äúrigorous‚Äù and ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù enough.

My suggestion is just an additional add-on to the recent key changes. You don‚Äôt need to get so angry over it if it doesn‚Äôt affects you. The school can also choose not to accept my suggestion for whatsoever valid reasons. 

Look, what‚Äôs the point of implementing policy changes in the name of fostering academic excellence and academic integrity when there‚Äôs an existing ‚Äùloophole‚Äù that students can exploit to escape from all these efforts of the school in implementing these changes for the better. Imagine encouraging participation, strengthening fair assessment practices, and valuing teaching feedbacks only to have their own high GPA students bypassing these policies by not having to take these modules at NTU CCDS in the first place. The school needs these high GPA students around to serve as role models and foster an intellectual culture that benefits other students‚Äô learning as well.   


Feel free to disagree if you like. What is considered ‚Äòdifficult‚Äô is not the same to different people (depending on their background). Someone with strong math background would find theoretical computer science (or basically any modules that are Math-intensive) easy to score. Someone with strong app development background + people skills would find the software project modules easy to score. This suggestion is to address a particular group of high GPA students from CCDS that exploits this credit transfer system by taking the software project modules (known to be heavy in workload, submissions, meetings, group work and subjective peer evaluations) during exchange. 

If you‚Äòre truly a GPA 5.0 NTU student, then you should be expected to demonstrate the same level of academic competency as expected of you in all your core modules for the major. 

This is my afterthoughts to the recent key changes introduced to uphold the highest level of academic integrity and standard at NTU. Yea true dat, but since this change would affect the entire school, it could be way fairer for other schools Oh I certainly didn't mean to imply that 'proper study requires attending lectures.' Sorry if that caused any confusion. Genuine learning and attending lectures overlap a little but they are still very different things. I see little value in forcing class attendance. The policy seems to be put forward with the idea that it would force one to learn. But in the first place, university education should not force anyone to learn. If someone chooses not to attend lectures, read textbooks, or do homework, that's his choice. Hello! If you are a CCDS student then CCDS is your brand The only drawback to not attending tutorials should be the lost potential of knowledge, not marks! the problem shld be the mid week announcement not the policy itself. Tutorials being compulsory is a norm in many other schools in ntu, we only had labs to attend lol even lectures r recorded. some schs even making lectures compulsory.. How'd you get these interactions if I may ask, through emails or did you set up appointments with them? Cost and transport are legitimate issues, but they really should be fixed in other ways, like more buses, bursaries, index swaps, professor teaching surveys etc. Not by killing/letting die the educational atmosphere of CCDS. Very bad incentives was creating a bizzare system where NTU would spend god knows how much paying for top talent from around the world to come to NTU, in large part paid by student fees, only for students to not engage with them. 1. That's assuming classes are in some significantly suboptimized state. Classes have enormous constraints, trying to create non clashing timetables for hundreds of students taking different sets of classes, booking lecture halls/rooms which can be booked by any faculty, difficult to quantify constraints like you must let students take enough mods to graduate on time. And not everyone thinks like you, some will want them more spread out so they can study in between / go to club activities / hang out etc. So unless you have some new scheduling algorithm that can fit these massive constraints, it's not a fix that even exists. 

2. Zoom is a joke. No one interacts through zoom. Studies have been done that show, not surprisingly, online teaching leads to worse educational outcomes. 

3. There is actually a massive effort by the school to survey students on teaching feedback so they can actually know who's good and who's not. This makes up some huge portion of professor KPI, according to them. And I'd like to point out 90% of students don't ever do them. No, I am not. My posts aren't longer than many here. And I have always supported it. If attendance was actually higher it wouldn't be an issue. But it got to ridiculous levels. My OS tutorial had two whole people including me. I've seen lectures of 100+ students where less than ten came. My OS prof once asked me in a bemused way why students, who pay thousands of dollars to attend university, don't attend the classes they paid for. There are studies done that show online classes lead to worse educational outcomes. So even with regard to exams, on average this supports the policy. On top of that, while it is unfortunate that students aren't incentivised to do things beyond exams, it is still a key part of a good university that students discover/learn organically. And this is a very big value add to many students, direct examples would be research opportunities or Rec letters from professors to engaged with you for masters and PhD programs. 

So while this does affect some negatively, on average this is a large positive. The whole empty class situation was getting out of hand. It is impossible that CCDS dean doesn't know about this. He has to approve this for it to become an official policy. Probably NTU provost knows this, too. [deleted] You mentioned that its ‚Äústudied‚Äù that people do worse if taught by online classes. I would love to see the evidence. Additionally, are you SURE that the reason you mentioned is the ONLY, or even MAJOR factor towards a student‚Äôs learning? Taking such a view is extremely narrow-minded, and fails to take into account the plethora of other factors that contributes to ineffective learning. 

Since you seemed to enjoy quoting studies, let me give you some:

1. A clear structure, framework, scaffolding surrounds, supports and informs learning (Baume and Scanlon, 2018). In NTU‚Äôs context, specifically, CCDS, I think many students can attest to how badly some of the courses are structured. Furthermore, ‚Äúscaffolding‚Äù, which in this case refers to sequential learning, is almost non-existent in many of these courses, simply due to the lack of effort (perceived or otherwise) on the bulk majority of the Professors‚Äô part to actually teach. In fact, many of these slides are simply copied wholesale, with some even bearing the source logos (i.e. MIT‚Äôs logo was still present on one of our course slides üíÄüíÄ).

2. Curriculum which addresses big ideas and which gives learners the big picture is most engaging. Coherence for the learner and the ability to make connections in different contexts is also supported. (Watkins et. al., 2002). Once again, NTU fails to provide for both an ‚Äúengaging‚Äù curriculum, and coherence for the learner. I think many can attest to how little effort many profs put into actually ‚Äúteaching‚Äù content, with many either just blindly reading off slides or simply droning on with little effort at engagement. If that is the case, why should students even bother coming down to school? As any good CS student will tell you, optimization is key. And in this case, coming to school for lessons is just simply a suboptimal solution. 

I shall not belabor the point further, but I think you get my drift. In summary, the school has many avenues to improve the learning experience for students, yet it chose a string of policies that negatively impacts most, the most. As mentioned above, there are many straightforward solutions to exponentially improving a students‚Äô learning in NTU - i.e. by making good quality teaching a KPI for Professors, rather than just research impact. Yes, we may have become a ‚ÄúWorld Class‚Äù university, but at what cost?

Also, before you go ahead to blindly defend the school‚Äôs atrocious policies, I think it would be prudent to actually look at things objectively, rather than simply claiming to do so, to avoid the risk of embarrassing yourself. It seems like common sense has been chasing you, just that you‚Äôve always been faster.

I know several TAs (PhD students) are like that in other schools though I didn't know that is also the case in CCDS because faculty members are teaching the tutorials in CCDS. Did you misread? Someone has taken the course for a semester but fell ill on the exam day. He automatically has an advantage when he takes the course again next year. Are you suggesting the scenario where the student, when retaking the course, is still sick enough to be in bed all day during the whole semester but well enough to attend the final? True dat that's why it's a good idea to implement zoom in the classroom too so that some people would choose to attend the class online instead I believe this is quite doable from their side too I think half the tutors don't give that much of a crap bro [deleted] Telling further ahead would've been good but you can still add drop for awhile. Sorry, I must apologise that I did misread your post. It is indeed a good point. 

To me, it also depends on the exchange university. Are the overseas courses much easier? The course lecturers are supposed to be strict on this. It makes more sense to me to be strict at this gateway instead of restricting clearing cores on exchange.

As to the situation that transcripts show half of cores being P/F, I guess anyone who's serious about the transcripts will ask for the transcripts from the exchange universities. If they do badly overseas, that's bad for them, too. The worry seems to be that their NTU GPA is high -- in that regard, I think what should be controlled is, when considering the honours degrees, the transcripts from the exchange universities must be taken into account. Where do you get the impression that someone can clear half their core modules on exchange? There is an AU cap in place for how much you can credit transfer from exchange overall. Calling the exchange system a loophole is quite a crazy cope, especially considering that you do still need to be relatively capable to get into a quality university of your choosing. Your 5.0 GPA student is more likely to pursue exchange in Top Tier Colleges, which themselves have far more limited slots than most of the other colleges offered by GEM. 

Also, you seem to suggest that the ideal NTU top scorer should forgo the opportunity to broaden their horizons with exchange and score all their A/A+ locally, wtf is the point of that? Why would you even incentivise that, when colleges are meant to provide opportunities to open up your worldview and receive a well-rounded education in your preferred discipline. Going overseas to experience the different pedagogies and tutelage of world-renowned professors allows for exactly that. 

I don‚Äôt really understand why you would want to limit this opportunity. just because something is already the way it is doesn't make it good. Which Engineering college made it's lectures compulsory? We ain't business students or humanities students. I am fine with tutorials being compulsory, just make it flexible timing where we can choose which tutorial to attend without affecting lab timing. Also just curious why are replying to this thread like super late? Yup, just ask. Not a lot of students reach out so you should have no problems getting in touch. TA‚Äôs  in particular Thats some next level of copium habibi. [deleted] We do attend them, through recordings. We do interact with them , just through different means. I understand if you find tutorials great, it‚Äôs great you find them helpful but that doesn‚Äôt mean it has to disadvantage students who aren‚Äôt able to come. It‚Äôs quite simple. There‚Äôs nothing stopping you from going to the tutorial. There should be no drawbacks stopping me from not going. [deleted] They pay thousands for the paper and networking opportunity. 

If they can pay thousands for that and skip out on all the classes but still get the paper and networking they would. Because some of the courses simply not worth even 1 sgd. Precisely, they are opening a pandora box It was being heavily abused. Of the dozens of tapau I saw get taken, none were actually legitimate. It was actually vastly unfair to many other people and created a perverse incentive to lie to get ahead. If they not giving a crap why implement such system. Don‚Äôt understand the school I think that part is smoke, the percentage metric in the email seems to be just participation rate A lot of indexes have 0 vacancies already, swapping multiple classes at this stage is very hard Students typically take a semester worth of modules (full-time load) while on exchange. This means at least 5 modules, and they would try to take more if there‚Äôs no AU cap (since it‚Äôs P/F). The only time students took lesser core modules on exchange is when there‚Äôs a situation they couldn‚Äôt map their desired modules of the exchange university back to their core modules. I‚Äôm referring to people who went GEM Explorer, and then SUSEP. Please read what I wrote before even commenting. Geez. Copium? Those are basic facts. And only copium is people acting like going to class is some impossible challenge. Educational atmosphere, it was a typo. And I'd like to add there's a lot of knock on effects, especially prof morale. Profs are very human and it's very disheartening when you want to teach but no one shows up. Not watching them, but engagement, and this has been studied to learn to better educational outcomes. It's not a personal opinion that I find it useful, it's a studied fact. And very expected that physical presence creates a more vibrant educational culture. And it is in a very big picture way a huge value add. It's unfortunate it's not more common or well known but there's lots more that comes from engaging with these incredibly bright profs from all over the world. 

Time to travel is a legit issue, but it should really not be solved by killing the educational culture. And in CCDS it was really bad, tutorial rooms were just ghost towns. There are some TAs like that, but most professors are actually good, legitimate teachers. Most who don't attend never attend in the first place not because they are bad, while there are a few like you who legitimately TA hop. And you could say they don't attend because it's just no efficient to because they can score well with less effort like this. That plugs into this whole bigger question of how do you incentivise students to do things beyond grades and create that culture of learning and discovery a university should have. The unfortunate fact is many CCDS students were very disengaged, in a large part because there's no reason to be engaged. 

But about this specific policy, it would be very bad to let this empty class situation carry on. It neither makes the TAs any better, nor improves education. Online learning has been shown to lead to worse outcomes in college. Solutions to that should be things like teaching feedback ‚Äã- which plays a very big part in the professors KPI. My OS prof was almost begging us to give him feedback. anyways since add drop isn't over, you can try to officially change your index first AU cap applies across both SUSEP and Gem Explorer. Also, you can only do partial-exchange SUSEP and GEM Explorer. You can‚Äôt do two full exchanges.

Anyway, still don‚Äôt quite understand the gripe with the current system. There‚Äôs literally nothing wrong with it. Sorry to say but however good a policy that has been implemented is only as good if people are willing to follow it. That‚Äôs how the world works. It is the tutors that did not show any respect for their students who broke the educational atmosphere. They just simply go though the answers and not even tried to interact with students. Lmao I have no idea why you are downvoted so badly, I guess the Reddit crowd is just predisposed to certain forms of learning. But I agree with you fully, a full classroom with strong engagement between students and between students and tutors brings a lot more intangible benefits and value than the people here realise. The current NTU CCDS classroom is a joke and it might as well be a fully online course, there are many more things that make a college education work than just listening to the lecture and tutorial content. I do attend tutorials, just not the ones I got registered to most of the time. Because I live FAR. and most profs like it/don‚Äôt mind it when I attend tutorials I am not  registered to and it‚Äôs never an issue. It‚Äôs all about fostering ‚Äúacademic excellence‚Äù and ‚Äúacademic integrity‚Äù. 

I also don‚Äôt see how there‚Äôs anything wrong about applying for coursework mark retention (if students met the learning objectives of the module, they shouldn‚Äôt be expected to re-do their coursework) or retaking quiz with a valid LOA reason. Why does the faculty want to make things harder for this group of students. The faculty then went on purporting that they are strengthening their fair assessment practices through grade moderation, particularly for the A-grade and also, implementing a participation bonus mark component for the CCDS modules. If the faculty wants to implement such policies, then it‚Äôs only fair that it applies to all. Else, do you think it‚Äôs fair to other students who have to complete most of their modules at NTU CCDS?

  
Sure, so what‚Äôs the current AU cap? Each core module is 3 AU yea. I expected it, CCDS especially like to ""optimize"" their timetable so they don't go. But in the long run they were essentially optimizing for worse learning. And there's also studies about loss aversion and anxiety which predicts this. ie it's not exactly a rational response that \*making people's go to class is a problem\*, but they're substituting how they feel about having to travel there with the value of the policy move and replying based on that. 

Anyways the old seniors who dislike it will graduate and this will be a large improvement for new students. I'm not saying you don't. What I'm saying it's from an impartial, 3rd person perspective, it is absolutely right that the school try to reverse course on the near empty tutorial rooms. They should not try to fix the transport obstacles by letting this situation continue and killing the educational culture of the school. Shouldn‚Äôt we be pushing against these policies, and not encourage them to ruin more things lmao. Why would you want them to make more things worse. If anything, it ironically encourages students to do better (and attending tutorials to farm the 5% and try their best not to tapau) so they can escape the hellhole that is NTU CS via exchange. As a government institution shouldn‚Äôt it be their responsibility to try and equalise the playing field as much as possible? Not to mention that since there‚Äôs always a lack hall spaces with many applying and not getting allocated one, they should only be encouraged to make things more flexible and more remote. No one‚Äôs saying they should make labs or exams go remote( yet some are conducted remotely) yet making tutorials basically compulsory (or incur a handicap) makes sense? They should but it would be very stupid to try and fix it by making education worse for everyone. The logic extends to Labs and exams, if it is so much better for tutorials to be remote then labs and exams should be remote as well. And then turn all of NTU into an online school. 

Halls would be an all round solution except for the money it costs to build. NTU is an extremely young school with a limited endowment (it gets about just 5k a year in endowment income per student). But you're always really encouraged to give feedback in the surveys they keep spamming our inboxes with. Hey dude,

I understand if you want this. Why wouldn‚Äôt you? You clearly seem to have no problem in terms of finance or family. You already attend your tutorials and now they reward you for it. You get rewarded while others get pulled down. That‚Äôs the best case for you so I understand why you want to protect the benefit you have. Also you may be able to afford more convenient modes of transportation or are lacking academically to have to really want this. Because Other than earning bonus points- this does not affect you in any way. I don‚Äôt want labs or exams to go remote ( but some exams and midterms are already conducted remotely ). But it seems you are unable to sympathise with those who are unable to make this work, it‚Äôs almost an impossible thing. But it‚Äôs normal to protect and defend the things that benefit only those who can afford it/have it and that‚Äôs fine. No hate And to your comments of NTU going online? So what? CCDS is a computing school. As long as people get the knowledge and can and grow and showcase their skills with standards I see no problem. It‚Äôs the best thing the internet has given us. It‚Äôs why I love computers. It why so many people from underdeveloped nations are flocking to CS. Because everything is online and easily accessible. There are many who have greatly benefited from this and now study in more prestigious schools than NTU. But I understand this breaks the level playing field for you."
CCDS is officially worse than SCSE,"New CCDS academic policies: https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/N84NQ35M2m 70% attendance rate + 12 tuts = no more than 3 absences

Byebye I‚Äôll go back to sleep Rather just skip anyways. Dont mind losing 5 marks.

They said 5 bonus marks means its on top of the 100% of the course assessment and not part of it. We shall rebel Hi, I am from SIT CS, can I have a context on why you guys don't attend tutorials at NTU, my tutorials at SIT is not graded, but I felt my tutorials are kinda blend, but I just go there to ask questions. Mostly for OS. But we tend to have people always hoarding/overflowing the classroom for the first tutorial then the last one don't really have alot of people. As a first step to promote attendance rate, they can just stop recording lectures >They said 5 bonus marks means its on top of the 100% of the course assessment and not part of it.

Functionally is there a difference? 

Unless you are scoring 100%, it is basically 5% out of 105% now. I guess it will wreck the bell curve [deleted] This is really something peculiar to Singapore and it absolutely has influence on the attendance rate. Look at the decent universities in Europe and US. Which one records every lecture? [deleted] There are recorded courses but these are still very few in comparison with the number of courses the department offers every year. Most often these recorded ones are general courses like Physics 101 which physical students don't actually take."
Do you regret going to ntu? (Over nus),"Today‚Äôs my deadline for NUS offer‚Äôs acceptance and I‚Äôve already done some admin stuff for ntu. Honestly I‚Äôm still on the fence and I want to get some insight from people who were in a similar situation like mine. 

For context my offers for ntu and nus were for econs.

The only reason why I chose NTU was that apparently it‚Äôs easier to get hall + less admin hassle. Also from what I infer, it seems easier to do well here with less competition. But apparently hall is not guaranteed for freshies? My main worry is that I plan to go to grad school and from what I heard, NTU isnt looked upon favourably for economics by Ivies/Oxbridge. 

I know this sounds silly but I just really don‚Äôt want to make a wrong choice where come a few months time, I don‚Äôt wish to end up thinking ‚Äúshould I have just went to NUS instead?‚Äù



 NUS and NTU are both competitive. Both schools are also well-regarded in academia. Do well in your major and you can go to any school of your choosing. Trust me at the end of 3/4 years when you go out to work. They will only ask ‚Äú can do anot?‚Äù They won‚Äôt ask which uni you from Nope, love ntu. Hall is practically guaranteed for freshmen. Possibly since it's a fixed asset and student applicants vary some might not get it but every freshmen who I know applied got it.¬† I'm an international student in NTU, and here's my 2 cents on this.

From a degree and quality of education perspective, doesn't matter which uni you go to. Either uni on your resume will be a solid seal of certification saying that you went to a top uni.

I keep seeing people complaining about NTU vs NUS all the time, which reminds me of a typical squabble between an XBOX and PlayStation fanboy.

For me, these 2 uni are waaaaaaaayyy better than the ones in my country, and that's all that matters. I feel that ppl rly don't appreciate what they have here and instead engage in this unnecessary war.

Anyw, it's all upto you and don't let anyone stop you from doing what you want. Have a good uni life for the next 3/4 years! Zero regret. I didn't even bother applying for NUS because I knew I was essentially guaranteed an admission with my GPA

3 years accounting degree compared to 4 years? That's an auto win. It doesn't make the commute any better, but that's 1 year I clawed back, and 1 year earlier I started my career

Think about whether you will regret going to NTU over NUS more than you will regret going to NUS over NTU. From your post it seems like the latter, and you already have your answer. You want to go to grad school in Ivies/Oxbridge but one of the reasons you choose NTU is because it is less competitive? For real? Less admin hassle? I would like to give a diff perspective here. Given the recent change in our NTU President who's evidently better based on his vision for NTU(based on the interview with Times Higher Educ recently) and NTU's climb in QS World Rankings 2025 from 26 to 15, and the fact that this is still considered a young Uni, means you'll be coming to a forward looking institution. I expect to be seeing alot of improvements over the coming years for NTU and it's future looks very promising. Other than that, you get guaranteed Hall, nicer, more serene campus(it's very peaceful here). For one thing, I don‚Äôt think NTU graduates are at disadvantage when applying for top graduate schools No, NTU is the best... in many areas.. i rejected nus for ntu. U come in u will know For undergrad - hardly matters. For context, went to NTU -> doing PhD at NUS. Both universities have pretty good professors (at least in my field). In terms of competitiveness, had several friends did their masters in Cambridge and delft. Best suggestion, go to the university that would give you the best experience that you want... Good that you knew it sounded silly, because honestly it does. 

As long as you do well in either unis, I'm sure you stand equal chance of further studies in grad school.

Hall stuff? If you put in effort joining those activities, why would you be given a chance for hall in either unis? Honestly both are the same. The most important thing is whether what you made your life in the future.

I see jobless hags who grad from NUS and NTU and refused to work too. Just hope you dun end up like them. [deleted] Yes. Couldnt change my major for like 3 semester and dropped out after 2 years Choose NUS.

Much better S/U system.
Better international reputation and ranking. Whichever one you think is better for you. Especially travel wise‚Ä¶ By car I can reach NTU in 15 mins or less, by public transport, easily 1.5h. hello, just wanted to give me two cents as an economics undergrad at ntu.

from what i know and heard, ntu‚Äôs economics is not as strong as nus.

that being said, ntu economics is largely electives rather than cores, which is something i prefer and enjoy, since i get to pick what i want to read rather than be forced to clear the mods.

some profs are better than others, and unfortunately the bad ones are the core mods profs.

as for hall, it is what you make of it. i‚Äôm a phantom and wouldn‚Äôt say i enjoy hall at all ‚Äî just a ground for me to study. Yes No. Never regretted it. In the industry now. Fresh grads are hired from both NUS, NTU or even SIT. Doesn‚Äôt matter which uni tbh. Nowadays internship experience plays a huge role. Think about where you want to go after undergrad and how grad schools view NTU vs NUS. No I was offered eng in nus but my choice of degree in ntu so I went to ntu instead nein, cos my lects are recorded It's really hard to answer. If your aim is to go Ivy then I guess both universities are ok. But my aim was more geared towards joining the FSAE team in NUS because I am a formula 1 fan boy. I graduated already and have no regrets. Personally, i don't regret it although I had a cde offer from nus along with the cde masters award, which I chose bcg from ntu over. Although I would have liked to go nus, the degree I get from ntu trumps bme by far in terms of career options,  which was what mattered to me then. If I was offered cs in nus, that would be another story, but I'm enjoying my ntu life for now. I would say nus hall gives the vibes of a sorority/frat, while ntu hall gives dorm vibes haha, most just use it as a place to stay due to travel distance. But hall life is what you make of it, regardless of which uni u go. For Economics I would go with NUS I think you already answered your own question Hello you mention you chose NTU because easier to get hall and less admin hassle‚Ä¶ think you are missing the forest for a tree. Did you consider other things like culture? Ranking? Professors? Modules? CCAs? Programmes? Yes, face value of the nus name still trumps ntu no matter what ppl say you should probably choose nus if you want to do masters in ivy league schools due to its reputation. Your ability to do well >4.5 depends on skills and hardwork, its not any easier in ntu. Can take me for example.

65rp in A levels> 4.50 y1s1, 4.64 y1s2
Students who didnt score well in As, can also decide to do well in uni, these are your competitors as well, lets not even talk about the international students here, they are another breed . Indeed, for further study such as PhD, it's better to go to NUS. Potentially better curriculum so that you don't have too many new things to learn in your postgraduate school. I hope that‚Äôs true because I think I might just stick with NTU and try to do my best with the extra things that come with it (Eg Hall)! I do hope that‚Äôs the case for overseas employment as well. How‚Äôs the culture though? I‚Äôll be honest, people from NTU seem very intimidating. well said. i'm local and i'm soooo sick and tired of hearing my people complain complain complain. be grateful üôÑ Op is very calculative mah I‚Äôm not even sure if that‚Äôs true, so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking. Basically I‚Äôve to do QET because of my GP grade for NUS üò≠whereas for NTU, I wouldn‚Äôt need to. What kind of tangible changes have you seen with his new leadership though? I‚Äôm curious. ooohh thats interesting. I was from NTU Mechanical as well! My batch mates and I totally loved it here and did not regret one bit. I think it mainly has to do with us staying in hall together and enjoying our uni life with one another (as well as doing well enough in terms of GPA) Ahhh I feel you. I was enormously unhappy with my major EEE and spent my first year trying to switch to computer science. Succeeded in my 3rd attempt but wonder why they had to make my life so miserable. Would you say there‚Äôs opportunities for undergrads to do research?

Also how do you do the phantom thing lol wow good job, what course are you in? engineering? idk why u are getting downvoted lol I have many friends who graduated from NTU that went on to do further studies in Ivies. The ‚Äúreputation‚Äù that NUS has overall is better no doubt but it pales in significance as compared to your grades. Even private degree holders who score well can get into LSE for their masters, what less can NTU offer you? Well..let me share some thoughts as a NTU graduate for almost ten years.. 

I picked NTU over NUS with similar reasons as you, cheaper and same knowledge, why not

Something I experienced in NTU 
1. Freaking noisy LT especially when prof can't speak fluent English 

2. Good prof left due to politics (I mean real good kind that they can even don't teach with lecture notes), or due to lack of research results (maybe too focus on teaching instead of bringing in funding to the school)

3. Admin staff with poor service quality and their attitude is annoying (trying to slack at job then always find excuses like ""you are good enough to study in NTU so I expect you can solve it yourself"")

For now, as I look back, which school also doesn't really matter as long as you're good at what you study. I got colleagues from NUS too, not really can tell the difference. I got a job offer one year before graduate and taking above average paycheck among the peers just after a few years, if future salary matters to you too

Lastly I think aside of academy, what are important that set you apart after school is your logical thinking skill, arts of talking, and how to work as a team

Hope this 3min read helps you.. last time I also was thinking too much lol but no one can ask for advices haha Don't need to hope. Overseas employers genuinely don't give a damn to your 'SG' degree lol. You think the HR from new York is gonna look at resumes and go 'hell no NTU hell yeah NUS I can absolutely tell the difference!' Great culture. Everyday is casual Friday. But more about you, what you're experiencing is known as loss aversion in behavioral economics. The specific phenomenon of comparing yourself to others and imagining a potential loss is FOMO. A lot of student/pre u student behavior is driven by this. For example most of it is FOMO/anxiety driven. 99.9% of JC kids aim for schools out of a mix of anxiety and loss aversion. Virtually none know anything concrete about their schools other than FOMOing that X is more prestigious than Y. If you are experiencing this, pick NUS. If nothing you won't get prestige FOMO of what if I chose NUS instead of NTU.¬† Why does ntu people seem intimidating? You haven‚Äôt met the smu students it seems. 

Ntu is seriously the kampong of the kampong. The jewel of the true kampong people. 

Studied both in smu and ntu and have relatives who graduated from nus. 

Ntu - lepak 
Nus - (not explainable but my description is ‚Äúweird‚Äù
Smu - aggressive HAHAHAHAHHA bro you go into ntu reddit  and say things like nus is more competitive than ntu what do you expect ü§°. So far I only got once, looked down by a random Bangladeshi who worked in the production line of the company that I served my internship.

 He blatantly asked which uni I'm from, then laughing at NTU not as a good uni as compared to NUS, gives me a thumbs down Both school are competitive. NTU has ICC modules that may impact ur grades in either ways, certain courses are also considered harder to excel (Base on my friends, Engineering is extremely competitive). 

Meanwhile, NUS allows you to SU (Pass/Fail) a couple of modules (even core modules) which certainly helps a lot.
Do note that: NTU only allows you to SU non-core/non-elective modules. 

So generally, both schools are extremely competitive, but if you are diligent and skilled in your field of studies, it shouldn't matter. Also, nus allows su AFTER grades release, whereas ntu allows only BEFORE grades release. Btw, Economics degree can be challenging if you are not good in both writing and also math. Stats and calculus are extremely important in certain modules, specifically Econometrics. So NUS's SU system definitely helps if you are weak in certain areas.

Since you are going for grad school, you might also want to look at research opportunities in both of the schools, it will certainly boost your portfolio. You can s/u those modules if you do badly for qet He actually just joined in fact like <2 years I think but already seems to have a better outlook for the University than the prev President but still early to say much. Yes, good that you enjoyed it. I think the experience is different for different people. I think the main reason me & my friends didnt like NTU was because none of us stayed in the halls. Also, birds of the same feather flock together. Me and my friends think similarly i guess. 

Good to hear that despite our different experiences, we all did well enough in terms of GPA I was in MAE trying to change to Math, and I kid you not, I tried 4 times (4th attempt was a joke at that point, since I knew I was dropping out anyway). And all 4 got rejected, despite me doing very well in IB HL Math and even doing EE in Math. 

Apparently GPA matters as well, but that in my opinion is such a stupid and weird factor, because doing well in engineering modules does not necessarily guarantee you fo well in math modules and vice versa. Even getting good grades in Math Modules did not help. It‚Äôs unnecessarily complicated There‚Äôs this thing called URECA, which is undergraduate research. Quite unique to NTU, good for those that wants to do research and stuff. I didn‚Äôt do it so can‚Äôt say much, but got a few threads on URECA in r/ntu.

As for phantom ‚Äî just don‚Äôt partake in hall stuff. Be a ghost. LOL

In order to secure hall, just join a low commitment school club, easy to get points by doing nothing.

All the best! Thank you. Im in EEE! I also came in with a mindset that ntu would be easier to score due to the low cut off point but I was so wrong. So many ASEAN scholars and international students scoring very good grades, but it also helps to mix with them because they are quite friendly and would share the answers with you if you asked. I think I worked like x2 harder than them while they were also doing some side projects and participating in hackathons. Ended up still scoring lower than them. I thought I would give a heads up to OP with regard to the ""competitive"" part so it doesn't matter the downvotes as long as OP is aware of this. Dude omg you literally described the situation I‚Äôm in; honestly I wish I could split myself up and be able to experience both schools at once but I can‚Äôt LOL. Honestly my main gripe for NUS is just that hall is uncertain(?) and that to me is one of my main priorities because I don‚Äôt really live in a conducive home environment. Otherwise I would‚Äôve chose it early on. 

I‚Äôve another fear as well- that if I choose NUS and I end up with no hall + bell curve kills me, will I just end up lamenting ‚Äúomg I should‚Äôve chose ntu where I could‚Äôve at least had hall‚Äù. Can't agree more with this comment. Even having being fch after y1 in ntu (cs) I sometimes still fomo when talking to my nus friends. Could have went to nus for a degree that I was more interested at and I believed I would have done better in. But then again, isn't application deadline closed already? Why OP asking now... just enjoy your time here la HAHAHHAH i really dislike ntu s/u but just llst since everyone also same lol I can do it, it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve to do additional things to matriculate into nus üíÄ Hopefully! I think I might just choose NTU from all of these comments haha. üòπ did you manage to secure a decent room type tho (like ac etc)? I mean I‚Äôm planning on joining some ccas related to career building, but I‚Äôm not sure whether I‚Äôd need to partake in hall committee/ activities. Which year are you in currently in NTU EEE? I actually liked how he said something in the interview along the lines of ""I worked as a Prof at UC Berkeley and found the Uni very conservative...now as President I will do to NTU what Berkeley could not"" Not word for word but basically what he meant haha hi! 

i did :) i just got offered hall 4 (one of the more popular halls) with 7 points. it is big, with ac, and clean.

as for decent room type, i think it boils down to personal preference. everyone prefer different halls. if you‚Äôre not picky, tamarind, north hill are easy to get halls cause not a lot of people fight for them.

as for points, 3 points is easy to get ‚Äî i am in a cca whereby i am just a member, have not attended anything and i just get 3 points for that.

you can secure an additional 2 points by applying for a double room with an international student.

generally 5-7 points are good enough for a hall as a senior.

if you want to have 7 or 9, you do need to hold a leadership position.

finally, just want to add on, hall points does not come from hall cca. as long as it is a cca in ntu, it qualifies. that‚Äôs where ntu and nus hall differs! :) Going y2 next year also‚Ä¶ i chose hall 4 cause it‚Äôs 3-5 min walk from SSS which is where most economics lecture and tutorials are held‚Ä¶. 

if you choose tamarind or north hill‚Ä¶ hais it‚Äôs quite a travel not going to lie. i personally have stayed at tamarind before and while its big and nice, easy to get etc, its not the most convenient location.

my advice is if you‚Äôre in need of a hall, don‚Äôt be picky. anywhere works.

if you have the bandwidth, join ccas and get a leadership position so you have the privilege of choosing better halls.

all the best! Omg I plan to stay at tamarind, but honestly idk if I‚Äôll get it because ik some ppl there who I wasn‚Äôt on the best terms with back in JC ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Can I ask how hall 4 is? They asking me to choose between 4 and 7 Doesn‚Äôt matter. Y1 is random allocation unless you are on rec list.

If you are keen on tamarind, just put single with AC communal bath. Highest chance to be allocated to tamarind / saraca / north hill. 4 hands down :) location is already a win lol do u really want to be waiting forever for 199 üòÇI not really aware of these details rn, can I ask about sports and the ""cUlTUre""? As someone trying to not be a ghost canteen ‚Äî tama has more food, but 4 is near crespion so i wouldn‚Äôt rly factor this
accessibility ‚Äî 7 can only be accessed by bus 199 (it is hell) while 4 is 179 and it‚Äôs the first bus stop into ntu and last bus stop out of ntu so it‚Äôs p fast to get in and out
culture ‚Äî 7 is p strong, i‚Äôm a phantom so can‚Äôt say much about 4 but i think it‚Äôs relatively decent since they did well for HOCC and interhall games
study room (if it‚Äôs a factor) ‚Äî 7 shares w tama and there‚Äôs 3, diff vibe to each i guess there‚Äôs variety. 4 is p homey Hmmmm alright, THX its been really helpful"

Erhm ... Alumni potential tourist,"Hi, I'm an alumni (graduated from EEE in 2015), was thinking about taking my boys to see their dad cool school. However, recent tourist issue gives me pause. Is it still a huge issue in NTU ? (from recent reddit posts, it doesnt seem to be an issue compared to NUS). If I walk around with my family will I be accosted ? Or do I need to register anywhere in advance ? Maybe bring my ancient matric card with me ? 
Thanks in advance. Iirc smal groups are fine, restrictions apply once you are deemed a ‚Äútour group‚Äù

Just try not to eat at the canteen during peak hours, don‚Äôt tour the classroom areas and I‚Äôm sure no one will bother you I was a bit surprised to see the recent posts here are very usual NTU stuff: course/club info, STAR WARS complaints, wild life (monkey, my time was hogs). I also lurk in NUS and they are quite up in arms. Maybe because we're too high up the mountain :))) Looking forward to a trip down memory lane. The issue we have with tourists is that they can be insensitive to the students there, take up space that is otherwise allocated for the students, loitering and making noise in quiter study areas. Yesterday I was studying inside SAC in North Spine, that place is specifically for students, regardless a bunch of tourists were inside making noise and playing pool. It was genuinely frustrating. I doubt you‚Äôll be on this spectrum of disruptive. Other than this I personally have no issues with tourists. NTU is a beautiful place and it would be a shame if people couldn‚Äôt see it. Hope you have fun with your kids when you‚Äôre here! It's fine as long you're not too loud! 

When I was studying at hive during study week, the security guards do round checks here and there. There's notices for visitors to not access lvl B4 and above (but ofc the tourists just do as they please). 

What's annoying is that they shout and also take pictures of the tutorial rooms through the glass (I was studying inside w my friends, we felt damn exposed üòì). 

So yes, as long your actions don't invade student's privacy, I don't think anyone will complain! üòä Honestly just avoid peak hrs and try not to take campus bus if got alot of ppl Its alright as long as yall dont board the busüôèüôèüôè we students are alr trying to fight for bus to navigate to classes and some of the sch bus literally have tourists>students Why read too much into it? I just hung out with my boy last weekend! The tourists are there to make the school popular. Just avoid their lunchtimes! Thanks for the reply. Like a tourist, I do want to check out the Hive and its interior haha, went on IA in the last sem and never got to see its completion. That means...these problems were never addressed by NTU after all these years LMAO Yea NTU is indeed very beautiful :) good luck + all the best in your studies They fight the bus with us! And its during peak hours!!! Honestly it's most likely fine as long as you're not disruptive/treat students there like zoo animals haha."

 Hi! Your post has been automatically removed because it looks like a new account.

If you're a genuine user, please hang around the subreddit for awhile before posting again :) You may also participate in the weekly discussion chat.

Not sure which advisor that is (he certainly doesn't sound like he's from NTU), but if you're a student, the first and foremost priority should be your grades if its not looking too good, than going for work experience. 

Re-plan your curriculum taking strategy down the road, keep an equal balance of hard and easy or manageable mods every semester. So you can spread your resources equally to keep your gpa afloat. Get the easy mods to cushion poor gpa from hard ones. 

Relook at your studying strategy and tactics and observe your friends, see what they're doing correctly that you aren't doing right. Wrt gpa, you're still a long way from getting academic warnings and ultimately kicked out from school, since the bottom line is below gpa 2 for semester and cumulative gpa. So just keep working hard and strategizing your path ahead. I think internships help to increase your employability which is technically not wrong but in your case I think you need to prioritise your grades. Don‚Äôt lose hope too fast too - have seen people who have climbed by leaps in their GPAs after specialising! Take a good break now and free up your commitments by the time school starts, try to group up with seniors (if you get into marketing) and maybe aim for a >=4.0 sem atb! blud, ik it‚Äôs tough out there, my result fell in this range only
but the only thing you can do is keep going, it‚Äôs going to be worth.
you‚Äôll do great next sem, trust yourself!

this might help-
believe me, i needed 17 au‚Äôs to get promoted to yr2, and i had 19, if i failed a single mod, im stuck and a whole year would have been wasted.
i didn‚Äôt handle that very well, i was stressed all the time, focussing on something that hadn‚Äôt even happened yet, but i continued to try. i got through, and so will you.
it‚Äôs not the end, 6 more tries to get it up! If you find the workload too overwhelming, I suggest spreading out your modules and graduating over 4 years instead. I hope you get the specialisation ur interested in too!! Hey the good news is you improved! That‚Äôs already cause for hope. You probably have a lot to deal with emotionally but it‚Äôs getting better. Don‚Äôt focus on what didn‚Äôt work but plan towards what might work. Make plans and try to stick with it Hey! Don't worry about the F's for now and just focus on doing well for the mods that you require to get into the spec of your preference (i.e. for marketing its stats and marketing itself). 

For the rest of the mods, it's not really essential to complete them in the next year if you feel like you need a break from them. I myself and a couple other friends are choosing to take Business Law in Y3S2 just because we needed a break from the heavy content. I, too, had a delay in specialising in my first sem of Y2. I managed to get it in Y2S2 though so don't worry!

As for your GPA, I too got a 2.90-ish grade but that was in Y2S1. I managed to pull it up to a 3.3 in one semester though so it's really quite doable! Make sure to find A grade past year examples for all your group projects and follow them religiously! You'll do fine :) Things will also look up once you get your specialisation because it's at least something you're interested in instead of the general business mods. 

I only got my internship in Y3S1 (Work Study Degree), so there's really no rush. As long as you complete all your modules, including the internship, before you graduate, all is good! Also, perhaps taking on an internship post specialisation is beneficial because you know exactly what sort of role/company you're looking for, rather than going for a general intern job. 

If you're genuinely curious about the WSD, you can take it for one semester. It requires a min duration of 35 weeks for you to clear your PA. There should be emails from the school on your outlook as well about it. 

Hope you feel a little less alone in this journey! And remember, we're studying business so even if we take a little longer than the rest of our peers to graduate, we would still be on track with the rest who are studying 4 year courses :) [removed] [removed] Yes I have Hi! it was a careerfit adivisor from ntu, but i lean towards ur opinion more! I'm really scared ofbeing kicked out, may i know what are the chances?üò≠ Thankyou!!! I will work harder and hopefully pull upy grades! thankyou so much! May i double check how is the au for promotion to y2 calculated? I got 16 for s1. 13 For s2 Thankyou!!!

Please be mindful and adhere to the rules in order to help make this community a better place.

If you think your post is wrongly moderated, do reach out to the moderators and we will review your appeal. Which criteria do you meet? The chances only come if your semester or cumulative gpa goes below 2, can have a look at the student guide from your school, its probably detailed in there. You have nothing to worry about if its above 2.

The thing about internships is you can take it whenever you want, even after you graduate. But for gpa you only have one single shot. it‚Äôs different for every course, the list is somewhere online, but for me it was 29, and you‚Äôre right on point I think you can try to appeal for marketing if that's really what you want! But if you got an F for either stats/marketing it would be best to redo these mods next sem, get a good grade and then get your spec in Y2S2. 

If you don't want to appeal for marketing, I think your best choice would be to go for your 2nd choice. If you havent really thought about it, do some research on what career prospects the respective specialisations will give you. Quite important especially if you don't want to start from ground 0 when you go out to the working world. 

I believe you can appeal via emailing nbs course registration! If they don't reply you within 3 working days, just call the office because they might miss out on your email. 

Honestly, nothing wrong with specialising only in Y2S2. I think that will give you more time to think through what you want as well. 

All the best! Let me know if you have any other questions :) Sorry you mean this? I was able to meet only some, but i followed to select all and arrange the sequenceof choice, with marketing being my first

We need buses like this to solve the bus problem ü§£ THAT‚ÄôS LESS CROWDED AH? elections coming Are they tourists LEAST CROUDED??? HOW CAN THAT BE MORE CROUDED??? Same situation for 179 I think. Both crowded around 9-10:30pm Why like this? Night buses are usually the worst lol there‚Äôs like 1 bus in circulation and always full Why so late still got so many students in the bus? School semester only started recently. can ask ntusu to get the bike sharing companies in ntu We need this plus it's double decker ü§£ HAHAH so true Yeah man, can't you see how many empty spaces there are? Guess metric for less crowded meant ""got space to take photo"" lol There are also quite a lot of PhD students and research fellows taking the bus at that timing. some masters students (esp part time ones) have lessons at the night 7-10pm slot too! this! this will be a game changer I rmbr asking my friends why no one had thought of this idea 
Those bike sharing companies will definitely earn money too oh ya this would be a great idea My condolences Wa sian. Imagine you are dog tired after all that studying, and still need to cramp inside the bus on your way home. Should be a preview for those who think 9 to 5 is superior to starting own business.

Few understand this. If want to work 9 to 5 jobs, better don‚Äôt go work at such ulu places such as NTU and Jurong Island and Tuas‚Ä¶ unless you drive a car."
"For graduating students: If you haven't found a job, don't fret.","Take it from a senior who graduated almost a year ago. (from SoH, if it matters).

Yes I managed to find a job before I graduated. But I worked there for a month before realising it was not a good fit in terms of job scope. I left. I spent a few months looking before being able to land another contract job before the year ended. (both are in the govt sector btw)

Well I stayed for a few months before I resigned again, without another job lined up. First few months were great, my bosses were quite supportive which motivated me to stay (and rejected a solid FT offer from another co). Then shit happened and I found myself constantly being gaslighted and belittled by the same bosses who I realised baited me with their fake generosity and kindness. at one point i was crying in the office almost every week lol. I left that place feeling super disillusioned and jaded by what happened.

so yeah, moral of the story is, it's better to stay unemployed (or at least work pt) and have a somewhat intact mental health, than to rush into a toxic work environment for the income and destroying yourself in the process. take your time, if it's meant to be yours then it will be yours. Govt sector is known to have the most toxic environment. Hope you are in a better work environment now op! Any reason you left before securing the next one? Unfortunately I didn't know about this until I joined as a proper staff :/ my intern experience was p okay so I thought I would be able to make it. Why is govt toxic, i tot private companies are worse.. thats why money higher in private companies Unless u are a psc scholar, government sector is where you go if you dont want to achieve your full potential and just want to rot and cap out at 10k/month by the time you are 50. most probably the work life culture or maybe start up company etc please don‚Äôt scare me lol i found a job and it‚Äôs in the govt sector too üò≠üò≠ im from SoH too.. do you mind sharing which stat board/ agency you worked at? Both can be equally as toxic (really depends on ur team/dept)

But based on my exp I'd say govt is toxic bc they promote ppl based on seniority and not on performance. U can perform well but cannot outshine ur bosses, so ur bosses may use ~sneaky tricks~ to weaken ur performance. This leads to a number of incompetent folks in the management level.

Private sector, on the other hand, focuses a lot more on ur performance and your networking skills so there's that."
For those who are struggling,"I'm a really lazy, slow and uninspired individual. Some of you probably have seen my rant a year or two back. I was struggling the entire 4 years. Quarreled with family and had nightmares of uni weeks after the exam period. Definitely a skill issue but hey it's over.

I don't have a goal hence why I continued studying anyway. Just wanna let the juniors who are struggling (in anyway) to keep at it if you can especially if you have no plans atm for the future. I believe the degree will help in some capacity regardless of what happens later on.

Thank you to those who gave me advice and those who shared kind words. All the best my juniors, learn from your mistakes and make effort to improve. Only make comparisons to yourself, not others. Congrats! :) waiting for this message to show up in 3 years ü´° https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/EAryYpP0m8

But it‚Äôs Circuit and Data Algo"
Fresh grads - how are you? ,"Just graduated as a MAE fresh grad. Been job hunting since March and I haven‚Äôt gotten a job. Panicking and parents are starting to worry. I feel like such a disappointment but I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong üòñ

Is the job market bad or is it just me????  Have you been to any interviews yet? Don't worry bah, seniors say job market bad and common to search for a few months. Also how fast you get a job is unfortunately relative to GPA too. So if you're like below 3 then maybe need search abit longer ... that said even low GPA 4+ has a hard time finding job sometimes. Hi, fellow MAE student here. Job market is not the best now, because headcount is low from the hiring boom after COVID.

I went for interviews at multiple companies, was rejected by all. My interview proficiency was not the best after self-reflecting. Do really put in effort to sharpen up and stand out.

FYI, one of the MNC companies that I went to interview for, had 500+ candidates vying for 12 Associate Engineering vacancies ü§£. A significant minority of the candidates were previous year grads. That should give you an idea on the market

I‚Äôve ultimately decided to sign-on and I have no regrets (yet). Job market is pretty bad now. Hiring freezes everywhere on top of the influx of ppl laid off from the layoffs in the last year.. keep trying but know that this is prob a difficult time to be landing something not just full time jobs. Applied for alot of internships positions .. close to none got back üò≠ In the same boat fam. Been searching since May after exams. Most of the time it‚Äôs no reply or simply a rejection email saying they found a more suitable candidate. Feeling the crunch as well. yahhhh, job hunting is tiring. Also from MAE, not that I'm part of the school's CAO or something but from talking to career coach Caleb, it did help to package myself and sell myself better (interviews, resume, portfolio if looking for a design role). So drop him an email if u haven't I guess and need some advice. After those coaching sessions I do find I become more appealing to companies and all. Still looking for jobs tho. everywhere hiring freeze right now.

i was supposed to hire 3 this year but in the end only hired 1. 

economy is bad and forecast is even worse. 

people rather hire experienced in this time of scarce headcount Needed to search 9+ months to get offered Do temp jobs while waiting for your dream job. If need temp job such as event helper etc let me know Hi Junior, yes it is a tough market this year due to slowdown of economy particularly in China. It is a weird situation we are at to have a booming stock market but miserable job market.

My company has just initiated hiring freeze couple of weeks ago, with travel restrictions implemented already since early last year. 

Anyway job hunt is a number game, keep sending resumes and ace the interviews, you will get there Companies hire around the start of the year so mid to late year is harder to find jobs

Keep sending resumes, it'll get repetitive and disapointing but thats just how it goes

Dont settle on a low salary, once you accept a below average salary, your next job wont look at the market standard but they will will at your last drawn salary and offer 10% more which equals to fuck all

While waiting to get a hired full time, get a part time and take certifications, that will beef up your CV Whats your honors class like? Government needs to stop importing so many foreigners while Singaporean graduates are having problems finding jobs! SAF DIS? Wow so many cucks around https://preview.redd.it/jj7xqhtoib9d1.jpeg?width=480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3697ae4494ab5c4a11c62cd8216ade270150f74f Nope, RSN haha"
Freshmen timetable,"How to check in NTU STARs? Cause i log in and i cant see anything (they mention will release from 26 july 2pm onwards)  bruh lowkey worried cuz it keeps telling me ""declare orientation"" when i go degree audit page but i already did.

The normal degree audit way is working now same my stars planner is empty but my audit info is showing up!! [deleted] Where are you guys seeing it? Could somebody pls send a link? Guys I typed in my course code in STARS and saw my classes and realised some were overlapping?? Does anyone face this issue tooüò≠üò≠ bruh i take comp eng and no math module is showing up on the degree audit? hi can i check if anyone else in BIE Y1 does not have CC0002 in their timetable even though its included in the study plan i‚Äôm really confused how to go about it!! 
correct me if i‚Äôm wrong: i go to class schedule and see a bunch of slots. i put the slots in STARS, and click plan to build my own timetable. is this right? Hi, ntu biz group B student here. Under the planned curriculum ML0004 is included. However, this ICC mod wasn't registered for me this sem. Does any y1 biz student face the same issue? same here Samee omg same same Omg yes same Same Same Adding on to this, you can go to STARS and put in the indexes to see it on an actual timetable. But the ICC mods have no index you can select in the STARS portal so that's fun. Same wth Thanks, works for me. Only cannot see CC0002 and CC0003 U add everything already then press plan? Its blank for me at the moment No leh :( i have some courses there but when i click view course timetable i get ""declare orientation"" Thank you! Timetable is up ü•≥ can pm me a ss of what u see?

Click on Degree Audit sometimes some classes are conducted in different teaching weeks I am from bie y1 too, and I don't have CC0002. May I ask how many AUs the sch assigned u? I was only assigned 13 AUs, so I am very sceptical as it is definitely underloaded since the usual load is 19 AUs. hmm if im not wrong u need to go to ntu Sharepoint then go to degree audit, you will see ur timetable that one can see here [https://wish.wis.ntu.edu.sg/webexe/owa/AUS\_SCHEDULE.main\_display1](https://wish.wis.ntu.edu.sg/webexe/owa/AUS_SCHEDULE.main_display1) yes and select ur index it will appear The T in NTU is silent... might wanna forget about this and check again 1h later? So weird. I didn't have this when I matriculated back then. Oops sorry, I deleted the comment because someone else has typed something similar, so I thought I wasn't contributing anything to the discussion. Didn't expect your swift reply haha.

Not gonna send a screenshot, but to answer your question, if we go into degree audit and scroll all the way down, we can see the modules to be taken for the sem. And if we click ""View Course Timetable"", it just says ""...complete your declaration in relation to orientation...""

And it links back to the declaration, when I've already done it during the online matriculation. Thanks man hii, i was assigned 14 AUs as i didnt take physics in JC so im taking physics A which has one extra AU but its still quite far off from the normal load, but have you emailed anyone regarding this? last night kept getting denied access to degree auditüò≠üò≠ today tried again and it worked, thanks! Hey thanks for all the info, this link isn't working could you please help? So those codes that didn't appear after we press plan doesn't start this sem? i got it! thanks anyways! yes, I emailed the school about this. They have yet to get back to me since it's a weekend :"" üëçüèª how abt this: [https://wish.wis.ntu.edu.sg/webexe/owa/aus\_schedule.main](https://wish.wis.ntu.edu.sg/webexe/owa/aus_schedule.main) anyway timetable is out now for mine And isn't the timetable planned for us alr?

How do you make friends in hall?,"How do I make friends in the same hall and floor?

I've attended hall top but sadly didn't really vibe with my group. Often time I would only bump into my neighbours in the toilet and it's kinda a weird place to make friends. I know people would say join hall cca but training only starts in week 2 and i'm staying in hall even over the weekends so it's been lonely this few weeks. Also the sport cca seems kinda intimidating especially when i haven't played it before. pls help a lonely hermit whose been hiding in their room all day, someone adopt me plsüò≠ Knock on their door and say player 3 has entered.

Jk dont listen to me i dont stay in hall Join hall ccas. They can range from sports to recreation games, like scrabble and chess. Even dance and jamband. You can get to meet other ppl from there.

Even still, you can also try and go for sch ccas as well. Although not from same hall, you can meet other ppl as well.

It is really ok if you can't vibe with those from the same floor. But tbh I think the most simplest thing is just attempting to say hi to them when you pass by them. I accidently said hi to someone I didn't know but was the same level as me but somehow I started to say hi to him again and again. (Cannot guarantee 100% chance uh, maybe 50%) yeah same i also don't know how to make friends w my hall mates :( Which hall r u in Rip off the band aid. Walk up to someone and say ‚ÄúHi, I am xxx‚Äù, how are you? What‚Äôs the worse that could happen? talk in the toilet lol i made hall friends even in the toilet. there is no right or wrong time to approach somebody. if they give cold shoulder move on and talk to another person! be active and initate 1st. somebody has to initate for the relationship to begin. do u want this opportunity to be in yr hands or theirs? I can't even make friends in my tutorials. Convinced majority don't want to make friends in my 3 years in uni Which hall are you in? Hi, y3 international student here, in my first sem I found it quite difficult to make friends in hall too :""> but don't worry, it gets better over time. It's completely alright if you don't really have friends on the same floor. I agree that it can get lonely over the weekends, so it helps to find others who stay over the weekend too. 

Additionally, I would recommend you visit the CCA booths during week 1 to find interesting school CCAs to join. It's easier to make friends who share your interests (most of my closest friends are from my CCA :)) I dunno, I just cook stuff in the pantry and that usually gets people to strike up a convo with me. Even got complimented a couple times for it, so it's a nice confidence booster. Checks out That's how my whole level became friends hahaha Same as OP, just that I didn‚Äôt manage to join hall ori. How do you join hall/sch ccas?  i tried, my neighbour just walk pass me and ignored me idt this kind of thing works in Asia in general.... Ayoo? For sch ccas, they would be usually be listed in the school website, which state the social medias and there is also a cca fair as well hosted next week so you can ask qns from there.

For hall cca wise, you do have to look a bit deeper. Some halls have their own instagram page, in which they mention about the hall ccas. Some but not all hall ccas do have their own instagram pages as well.

In addition, some halls also have telegram pages to disseminate information, esp the list of ccas. i would not recover from that WHAT HALL IS THIS I JUST WANNA HAVE A TALK WITH YOUT NEIGHBOUR That helps to identify the weeds! So move onto the next person. You should try again! Try casually smiling when you see them, and if they do return the smile after a while you can strike up conversations and stuff, for example if you see them staying over the weekend can just ask why. Thats how I made friends in my hall, at least my neighbours. Also, now you have 2 others here who are asking which hall you are in. That‚Äôs a good start to reach out to them. I disagree. I am Asian, and I do this. I don‚Äôt make friends easily as well. It was hard at first, anxiety creeps up and makes you think otherwise. After a few times, you get more confident. Honestly, if it works then all good, no harm trying. crespion things im from crespion too! maybe we can be friends! Eyy wassup crespioner"
I got robbed by a monkey,"I got robbed by an monkey bro wtf
I am y1 biz student international and I didn‚Äôt know I could get robbed by monkeys üò≠

IS IT OK TO SKIP LECTURES !!!,"bruh im so tired.... idh a hall and my lectures all starts at 830am... yes u can tell me to switch indexes but BRUH the indexes for lectures remains at 830am HAHAHHAHHAH and i take exactly 1.5hours to reach my lectheatre..

i noticed that the lectures ive attend the past two days are q boring in a way that i can access the materials via ntulearn n watch the video instead. ive already pre-read some lectures before school started. + my prof didnt even finish the first chapter üòÖüòÖüòÖ 

ig studying myself is better for me since its more productive. and the learning style of lecture is similar to POLY which is whr i came from heh

edit; oh how to check attendance ah üòÖüòÖ Just skip your lectures and watch the recorded once it is uploaded. I doubt there is attendance taken anyways for lecture Depends on lecturer and mods u are taking. Some take attendance through wooclap to get class participation marks. Ay same, no hall and 1.5 hrs travel time. 

I'm checking out the lectures in the first week to see if I can skip them. Yesterday's one was okay to skip, I'll see if today's one (the 0830 slot) is okay too. 

It depends on your lecturer btw. Apparently all lectures are recorded but whether they'll be uploaded depends on your lecturer. 

I suggest going once first to see if it's worth it. generally, it is ok to skip lectures, provided u take note of that module's assessment criteria. for example, if that module consists of in-lecture assignments such as wooclap or normal pen & paper questions that are graded, then you will have to attend those.

if in-lecture assessments don't apply, and if the profs did not take attendance (since you've attended some and you would know), then just skip. i know of people who never attended a single lecture before but they still end up doing well because they study at their own pace.

this also means they someone from a totally different course can crash into lectures they don‚Äôt take because nobody would know hahaha Attendance usually cannot check online or whatever, from what I rmbr, but when you go for your lessons they will hand out a name list to mark that you were present. Most lectures don‚Äôt have attendance. But very dependent on the mod/prof. I must have attended no more than 20 lectures in my time at NTU. To be fair, my undergrad was in business, but I did a lot of SPMS and SCSE/CCDS courses so take that as you will. My grades were still decent. Boring? Not CV1012, its fire bro depends on your course, how you learn things and how well prepared you are. in uni, you take charge of your own learning.

as others have said, most lectures are recorded and you don't have to take attendance unless otherwise stated. course outline and grading criteria usually explicitly stated in first lecture or in materials given online. 

I usually prepare ahead and understood 80-90% of the lecture if the lecturers gave out slides ahead of time. some lectures don't contribute much and can be skipped easily but there are others that are worth going for tho! personally, going for lectures for me serves a few purposes tho..

1. seeing how the lecturer thinks and present these ideas, and comparing it with my own and make a value judgement.  

2. to meet like-minded people, test my active recall, observe where my blindspots are..

3. the slowness allows my head to daydream. leading to asking myself questions, coming up with examples, and forming connections with other things I've learnt throughout the years. esp if it's a topic I'm fairly interested and want to be good at, and there's a clear end-goal for where the lectures are heading towards. Yes it is provided they don't take attendance or attendance does not count towards your final grade. So go check up on whether or not thus matters and if it doesn't, feel free to skip those lectures Yes you can skip lectures If recorded? Yes. I skip max 2 times for each mod LOL ü´° generally, i only skip physical lectures IF 1) the lecture is recorded and uploaded to NTULearn, and 2) the professor is not assessing class participation during the lecture component (most don't in my experience, but some do). First week tends to be boring and just talking about assessment format etc., but that's also where you can find out if those criteria are met, so I usually attend first week at the very least. First week also tends to not actually finish class stuff because... add drop still ongoing, they want to minimise difficulty for people who only get the course registered after add drop a lot of the times. 

Whether those criteria are met is very dependent on faculty, in my experience (SOH/SSS mods mainly) they don't upload lectures so I have to go for almost all the lectures. I‚Äôm gonna report all of you for ‚Äòpontain‚Äô school unless you pay me to check your attendance üòú Depends what school u in lol. 

If u r taking engineering degree, chances of ur lectures not taking attendance is 90% so jsut skip lol wah the lec theatre so big got attendance sheet hahaha Ya lol, I‚Äôve been to one they give out attendance sheet. So really depends on prof. Oh someone mentioned wooclap also, ya some do that instead."

Is this a scam,"I hope not but I cant stop being skeptical gift card = scam excessive use of ah even for Singaporean. sus af looks like a scam to me. meet up in person and actually see the guitar in actual condition before paying

if u pay in cash he could also just buy the gift card himself with the money u pay, why make u buy the gift card first? doesn't make any sense I'm a regular at r/scams and I can tell you yes this is a scam. 

Anytime sellers request payment in gift cards it's a scam: otherwise why can they just accept your money and use it to buy said gift cards themselves?

Scammers want gift cards because it's a payment that's not traceable and not reversible. 

Also, notice that when you ask questions about the guitar the only answer you received is a bunch of pictures. The pictures are stolen. And the scammer answered this way because he knows nothing about guitars and so cannot actually answer your question MA‚ÄôAM WHY DID YOU REDEEEM ITT Always deal in person 100% scam Yeah seems like a scammer trying very hard to mimic the Singaporean way of conversing. Regardless of whatever you're buying, make sure you can see and feel the product with your hands before paying. Gift cards are also a typical red flag because they can be used universally easily without being traced etc. (e.g. it's harder for an overseas scammer to open a bank account in Singapore to receive funds vs. redeeming a gift card) Scam for sure , my friend fell for it gonna keep it real, if it isn't obvious to u that this is a scam, u shouldnt be in uni... Dude asks you to buy a gift card and send it to someone = untraceable, unreversible transaction.

Says he will send you guitar after you do this, and you have zero ability to find him if he doesnt.

And you are skeptical? You should be convinced it's a scam. 

You don't know the guy, you haven't met them in real life, and you're not dealing on a known platform that guarantees the transaction

You should ask yourself 'Why would I get into a transaction where I have no reason to trust the seller, I risk my entire payment and have zero ability to recover it?' it‚Äôs a stupid scammer trying to scam Gift card is scam. Usually is meet at mrt and exchange item & money there ask him to give you $20 so u can help buy him $40 gift card SCAM. CAPS LOCK FULL STOP. SCAAAAM!! Scammmmm You ah, really want to get scammed ah? Gift card ah, is very obvious ah. 

The ah here ah there, is also quite obvious ah? I mean bro, you go university liao right. I think this one can ownself decide ba. üòÇ This is why I Always do carousell deals in person and cash only Give the giftcard to him in person lol Yes it is definitely a scam. 

Try checkmate.sg is an ai/crowdsourced chatbot to check messages like this for scams. Or also you can use it to report them! 

We share the database with everyone. https://preview.redd.it/9mfke4wpbnkd1.jpeg?width=510&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=75f944ed91afcdb526f42ea51a100a5be80273d4

Looks like the pictures were from this seller on Carousell. The guitar was already sold out to someone long ago. That shape of the guitar definitely looks 'acoustic' Gift card: Scam

Weird use of punctuation marks (you do not put spaces before them!): Scam!

The uses of ‚Äòah‚Äô are ungrammatical in Singlish: Scam!!! Never pay for something before you receive it if it's not an official transaction. Tell them must meet up if they want Just meet up in person. No questions asked. Yes. Ty all !! 100% a scam. Don‚Äôt pay for the gift card and send to him. Don't even try buying the gift card and give it in person. The gift card may not be legit. Enter your CC or bank detail to buy the gift card at risk. Or likely they will send you a link to a site that has been compromise. do not redeem Send a fake giftcard la.. waste his time too Maam why did you redeem it??? No one, and I mean NO ONE, would ask you to pay with gift cards. Anyone who does is trying to scam you. Do you actually wanna buy the guitar? Lol 100% scam.. How to tell? 

1. They ask you to pay by gift cards. Nobody prefers gift cards over cash. Except scammers, because gift cards dont have to met f2f and can't be traced. 

2. They will ask you to show the code and the scratch-off PIN on the gift card. Once you give it to them and they redeem it, you will never hear from them again.

3. They will never meet f2f. They will say they are going, up chit they won't actually turn up. If you feel suspicious, always insist by offering to meet at their place, 'I can drive to your place to deal so you dont need to lug the guitar all the way to mrt and I will give you the gift card code on the spot!'
If they give so many excuses, move on.
This works like a charm for me since 2014 when I started using l in carousell sg got ah here ah there ? Yes Just tell the fellow you want to view the guitar and see what he/she says. Gift card? Changing from meet up to just sending? Sus. 100% a scam. 100% scam. I have never in my life met anyone who prefers gift cards to cash. Anyone who claims they prefer the former is blatantly lying Most likely Probably foreigner trying to sound like a local Fk la ofc la pundeh do what degree Haha that guitar does look acoustic tell him agreed, and lead him on. Keep wasting this scammer time, and send him photos of fake receipts It's a scam!! Ï°∞Ïã¨Ìï¥Ïöî! Yes,  always haha bros comming to skl tuesday apparently so idk man Gift card now cant pay by cash, sg make it such that apple pay and stuff need to use credit card to buy Your comment needs to be higher. love kitboga I didnt do antthing yetü§£ hahaha i didnt know what scammer meant by gift card till now Too many Ahs in the wrong place kinda bothered me.
And they asked for a gift card.

I always advocate for meeting up,seeing and testing it first then paying. Yah sounds like a China person trying to add ‚Äúah‚Äù to sound Singaporean. I was just confused lol Yeah. Ah lam pah Tf, that's not relevant. Anybody can get scammed. üôÑ meeting Singaporean scammers for the first time in my life Didnt know he was looking for photo I was abt to do that lol I just want a shit guitar so i can throw away after moving out from my dorm any recommendation? Í≥†ÎßàÏõåÏó¨ You‚Äôre so silly, you believe he‚Äôs coming to school on Tuesday üòÇ take my vote DO NOT REDEEM IT [Reference to what he meant](https://youtu.be/sOcFnDSJZoc?si=7-cHzrbIGzUaaX9-&t=1664) Understandable, but yeah your instincts on point for this, sure scam. Maybe scammers are foreigner You can download the Carousell app and take a look, it's a platform where people buy and sell used items in Singapore. hahaha lmao thx bro
guess my instinct saved me on the 2nd week of living in singapore haha welcome to SING JIA PO"
I‚Äôm so confused as to why I got rejected ,"My friend who had gotten a 96.4% average made it in for computer science. He didn‚Äôt apply with anything other than his high school results. Another friend made it into mathematics and economics with a 95% and he also didn‚Äôt give them anything else. 
I applied with a 96.2% average for physics and mathematics. I also gave them my sat score, my Toefl score as well as my JEE advanced result. I didn‚Äôt do great in advanced but I did pretty well in both Toefl as well as the SATs.
Isn‚Äôt physics supposed to be less selective?
Why did I get rejected? You probably applied with tuition grant and they didnt Are you international student? No offense, but maybe you should try a course that is not cs or ce. every single indian goes to cs, so that's why the quota gets filled up. However if u rly still want to do smth related to ur degree, u can still appeal for dsai, ai and society or bcg. otherwise just consider another degree. anything from ccds is going be very competitive.

and again SAT results are not an impt metric for singapore unis, they matter more for US unis so they don't really look at those. Hey i got rejected with a 97.2% in cbse (applying for comp sci). I gave sat,ap,ielts and also the jee mains and jee adv result. I did pretty well in all of them (adv was mediocre). We‚Äôre in the same boat buddy Try other uni, china tsinghua is well recognised or Tokyo or HK. There‚Äôs always options since your grades are good. I got rejected with 98.8% 2 years ago lmao There is quota for every country and others factors which not explicitly mentioned by admission [deleted] NTU grad here - CS 2022 batch, scores aren‚Äôt everything. I had a 1590 SAT, 96% CBSE etc. 

Did you have extra curriculars? Sports? MUNs (not school ones but international affiliated ones), social service (not the fake certificates) etc. 

I‚Äôm going to go out on a limp and say scores are just the first leg. We‚Äôve had a few AIR 100s at NTU and seen AIR < 100s get rejected because of no non-score achievements. What was your SAT score? Same here man. Although I didnt write advances, I have a 95% average along with a good SAT score where I have an almost perfect math score. I still received a rejection. Feeling really down. Just gonna pray for NUS I also got an aggregate of 96.2%, and got a decent percentile in mains and a mediocre rank in JEE Advanced.. I also had a lot of extracurricular activities, yet I was rejected for aerospace and mechanical engineering.. I m in the exact same situation as you. Rejected by NTU despite 96.8% and decent advance score. Did you apply to HK? Honestly I feel that every year the amount of people scoring high are increasing (probs due to the board getting easier and easier every year).

 In my year of admission itself, there were more than 40000 people who got 95%+. And this number keeps increasing every year, which causes this inflation and hence pushes the requirement even higher. So if I had to guess that's probably the reason why. Bro, general election is around the corner, so less international students and more local students, otherwise the majority party will have another hardtime to convince they are here for the citizen, maybe you take a gap year and apply next year, after election, totally different story. I too got rejected but i put in cs prolly that's why , my boards i got 95.6% tho maybe that's why. I had put in my jee adv. rank but ion think they give that priority. Each country has its quotas. Perhaps your country's quotas is already max. Meanwhile, me retarded expecting admission with 91.4% in cbse board and 16k rank in advanced CBSE or ISC? And what were your subjects must be lousy score Same here. 96.4% in CBSE, 1570 in SAT, 8.5 in IELTS. Got rejected for aerospace engineering. in class 12 CBSE currently 
Want to get into CS next year 
Provided i don't apply for tuition grant, what marks should I target in the boards


I got 95 percent in class 10 
Pls reply guys How exactly does the metric work for International Students ...I am in class 12 CBSE currently and I want to get into cs...academically what should my target scores be provided i don't apply for tuition grant 

Would love an answer 
PS I got 95 percent in class 10 Omg just get over it and relocate to a bigger country with more opportunities like the USA. When you become so filthy rich, donate money to NTU and name one of the schools after yourself. Big name plastered on the building. That‚Äôs what I would do ;) this. i was specifically warned by someone ik to not apply with the tuition grant cuz it really shoots your chances down [deleted] Yes I didn‚Äôt apply for CS. 
I applied for a dual degree in physics and maths.
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm a little stumped. Because it seems as though the mark requirement for cs is just barely above mine. So I thought I should have gotten in for physics. u were never gonna get into comp sci with 97.2, its usually 98 or 99 Just need to deal with it I guess. Only thing to do is move on now. What was your sat score if u don‚Äôt mind sharing, and did u apply for tuition grant? no way you‚Äôre thinking of getting into THE tsinghua üíÄüíÄüíÄ it‚Äôs way harder to get into that uni than NTU/ NUS lmao. yeah same here Same with 96.4%. Appealing for mech this time. Maybe there are many other people that scored more than 95% that applied Strange. It‚Äôs probably the tuition grant thing. Go for a full 100, man, why you gotta limit yourself I‚Äôve seen 98%+ to be the ‚Äúsafe‚Äù zone [deleted] I know some International students from local poly/jc with a high gpa getting rejected. I think preference is citizen > PR > international. You have a very good score, but maybe due to limited seats and high demand for the course they rejected. Did you try to appeal ? Why bro got downvotef for this lmao Not getting my double degree of choice was the best thing that happened to me back in uni.  Double degree turned out to be super overrated imo, especially if it‚Äôs a 5 year program.  You do that much more just to fall behind your peers.  Rather do a single degree + masters. My friend got in with a 96.4% and nothing else. Op mentioned in their post that their friend got in with 96.4% 1530 sat and yeah i applird for grant I think the bigger problem is that this guy is Indian and he will struggle staying in China with the language problem and everything I guess for some singaporeans, they always think China lousier. Okay that's ridiculously high mate! 
I'll try my best i dont think parent's occupation matter...thats a  ridiculous factor in SG universities lmao sg only cares about your grades they dont rlly look at extra curriculars or parents income. Maybe OP's overall percentage was lower? Thank you very much. This is very helpful and puts things into perspective. 
I guess I just need to move on. I did. But I don‚Äôt think anything will really come of it. It‚Äôs alright I guess. Just have to move onto the next thing.
Thank you for responding. U must have applied w the tuition grant, there are a few seats allocated for the people w the grant, those must have been filled that's why u were rejected. what kind of extra curriculars did they have There are other factors like essay involved too. oh mb, then thats unfortunate, i guess tuition grant, and extra circulars might have made a diff Wow your stats are really good, hard luck man. ye the grant thing was prolly the deciding factor cuz our applications seem similar but i got cs

i heard you can appeal tho? I got 96% cbse and 1570 (800 Math) SAT but still got rejected for CE... Seems like the computing majors have been very keen this year true, cos everything is taught in chinese there Who said? Where? U drunk or sth? as a singaporean who‚Äôs in NUS i swear i can‚Äôt even get a single toe into hsinghua. i‚Äôve seen their gaokao ( a level equivalent¬ø ) paper and i wna cry [deleted] Idk how it happened but one of my friends got in EEE with 94% with tuition grant last year but OP and I could not with 96-97%, what is the reason that we don't know? My overall was exactly 96.2%. It‚Äôs probably the tuition grant thing that‚Äôs the deciding factor in the end. Idk though. No point worrying about it now. Quite a lot of Singaporeans think that. I‚Äôve a relative who got a scholarship to Tsinghua and this uncle asked is it cannot get into nus / ntu so have to go China uni. Pls lor, the caliber of Tsinghua far exceeds our local uni.
Anyway the original comment already implied the same (cannot get into nus go try Tsinghua) Yeah I know. I guess my comment came off the wrong way. The caliber of any Tsinghua student far exceeds our local uni students. But I know a lot of Singaporeans who always think China = lousy. I‚Äôve a relative who made it to Tsinghua on a scholarship and this uncle said ‚Äúis it cannot get into nus/ntu‚Äù so have to go China study? üôÑüôÑüôÑ Yup i understand. I believe it could just be a general data collection or might be used to determine if you could get any financial aid, etc. SG educational institutions is always known for their heavy amount of financial aid too (grants, busaries and awards). I met alot of foreign students from low income background, its quite normal and nothing to be shamed off here in singapore üôèüèΩ

It always your GPA/RP/board scores over anything plus qouta for the academic year intake unfortunately. Youre right about the diversity intake He just suggested to try for other top unis and that he shouldn't restrict himself to study in only ntu/nus. No-one thinks that those are ""easier to get in"". [deleted] [deleted] lol can‚Äôt make it to ntu / nus, no need to think about applying to tsinghua. I am curious how admissions work too. Could it be portfolio ? relevant projects etc Cus some ppl in local uni really think ntu / nus is big f. (If they form some third world country, can understand lah). Disclaimer I also from ntu so don‚Äôt say I local uni reject and salty. nO nEeD tO tHiNk aBoUt aPpLyInG tO tSinGhUa, i dont understand what ur problem is. The only reason he didn't get in is because there are a lot of strong indian candidates who got in, that ntu reached the max quota of indian admissions.

This guy got a decent rank in the second level of the hardest college entrance exam in the world (Just to put into perspective millions of candidates give the first level of the exam JEE Main, out of which only the top 100000 scorers are selected for JEE Advanced), which put every single other uni's admission requirement to shame. So this guy got gatekept just coz ntu has strict max number of students they can take from a country. 

Don't be salty that the guy is actually leagues smarter than u and talk shit without knowing anything :))))) I have a filed Patent related to mechatronics too. It's just frustrating that I'll never know where I lacked I feel like only the people in local uni will actually know how shiet ntu and nus are Yes exactly. There are many strong indian candidates. That's why OP's 96.4% might be considered low as compared to other candidates that might be higher. Not surprising that OP got rejected You seem quite butthurt lol. Sorry if I hurt your ego. Okok he can definitely make it to tsinghua ok. Ntu is the best uni!!! Yep, and every year the number of people scoring higher also increases. It's basically inflation but for marks hahaha literally none of ur replies make sense, u ok mate? i understand, depression can suck... :p Huh depression is considered an insult? Are you really acting like that‚Äôs a burn? 

Sigh I mean you are the butthurt guy typing some longass comment about how smart this Indian guy is and insulting me first etc simply cus the only comment I made was that tsinghua is (objectively) a better uni than ntu and still is now. 

I don‚Äôt even know why you need to keep arguing about this (perhaps making it to ntu is the proudest achievement in your life which is seriously pathetic. lol most local Singaporeans in ntu/nus would know how shiet our own universities are on the international stage unless you are from some third world country and ntu is prob your escape route to a better life.) 

Also I don‚Äôt have depression but I actually know and work with people who have it and other mental health issues and it‚Äôs not a joke or an insult. 
Seriously are you ok yourself? Blocking you anyway because you sound like a seriously insecure person (over ntu of all things LOL) and extremely unkind & cruel for actually thinking depression is some kind of a joke or insult."
Let old man (Y4) tell you kids about Tong Tar,"Before CDG took over as the provider, things were a lot worse than now.

Tong Tar was our previous campus rider‚Ä¶ company? Provider? You get the gist.

Rude drivers, dirty busses, and any complaints you may now with regards to punctuality are mild compared to what our seniors had to deal with.

The best quality of life improvement was making busses terminate at North Spine instead of Saraca hall, no more being awkwardly stranded!

I take the campus rider everyday, I know how late it can be and how crowded it can be. I murmur complaints under my breath when I have to squeeze in a wet bus in the rain. 


But just know, it could be a lot worse.  This this..

How can you forget the fact that you may not even know whether the bus is coming or not ü§° Can‚Äôt see it on UWave app either. 

Buses terminates at Saraca for Blue, Hall 11 for Red. And there‚Äôs no empty replacement bus from the last stop, they only start from the next stop. 

Where the buses are all coach buses(except for 2 City Bus & a few low entry ones), squeezing through the crowded narrow aisle with your bag and theirs.

The empty seat on the crowded bus, is definitely missing a seat cushion or occupied by some boxes. At times, we dislike sitting on the front seat that has the wheel arch. 

Getting ‚Äúkiap‚Äù by the door is so common then. You can see this appearing on UWave almost every month.

However, TongTar has provided more buses during peak hours. While the operator has been seen with poor performance, the school is still responsible for not providing a better solution. I agree too, as a Y4 old man üòó

But still we need to improve the services instead of letting CDG taking advantage of it. CDG should uphold their standards and provide better (or at least maintaining) transport services to us. My biggest shock with Tong Tar was seeing 3 B2Bs Red Buses at Tamarind Hall (2022) in the morning. Sure CDG has alot of mistakes but it really could have been worse so i try to think positively :/ As a Y4 laojiao I still rmb the chant

F\*\*\* TongTar Recent grad here, not wrong. CDG at least has much better buses themselves. However, we also didn't have the tourist problem back then so the recent decrease of frequency, increase in student population in general after covid, and the tourism boom most likely led to very bad congestion as well. It‚Äôs true that we shouldn‚Äôt underplay the improvements made so far and that we often overlook them when discussing about the state of the bus service. 

However, I think the main focus now is on seeking clarification on the blocking points preventing further improvements to be made, particularly for the bus frequency. I‚Äôm sure many of us will be more understanding if we are made aware of the struggles faced too. the only thing i miss about tong tar was the friendly auntie at pioneer who i always say good morning to https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/ogZKHYvlpG still hope this becomes a reality (and that the creator is rightfully credited) https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/ogZKHYvlpG still hope this becomes a reality (and that the creator is rightfully credited) For a period, you could on Uwave so I didn‚Äôt include it

But it was also inaccurate anyway so you‚Äôve got a point HAHAHA Yes yes, I agree standards have dropped since last year. For a while it seemed things were going up

But it‚Äôs easy to take improvements for granted, and the doom posting on how bad campus rider is right now is kind of hillarious when you look back at how abysmal Tong Tar was Tbh, I think it‚Äôs more of a school issue rather than the operator alone just by looking at how they manage to support the examination period with extra buses. Yes, but I‚Äôve given up tbh.. üòÇ

Quite inaccurate for a number of times already ‚ò†Ô∏è The Tong Sampah era üôÉ"
Looking for people who I accidentally spilled my crowded bowl on.,"As per title. Looking for people (1F1M) who I accidentally spill my crowded bowl on when riding the Blue loop bus around 5:10 pm. 

The bus driver made an unexpected and dangerous acceleration when turning from Nanyang walk to Nanyang cres. Despite I have already use the handle at one hand, I was still forced to use another hand (one with my take-away) to stabilize myself in the emergency. It was a total accident, I am very sorry for any inconveniences I have caused.

If you are the unlucky one, please PM me. I will provide cleaning charges to make things right.

If you know victims, I would appreciate if you help me to relay the information.

In the event that I cannot connect with the affected individual within the next two weeks, I intend to donate to a local orphanage charity.

Thanks
 Nicest person in Sg Or if any people have recommendations for specific charity organisation that related with children. Make this guy NTUSU president i am the unlucky one, the victim and the local orphanage charity Little confusion.. wouldnt it usually be asked on the spot? what are u looking to do with the donation? Why are you even carrying a crowded bowl on a moving vehicle? I always suggest TOUCH Community Services because you get to choose the cause you wish to donate and they match your donation dollar for dollar. I alone am the honored one Ya, I asked on the bus and also offer my contacts, but they said it is alright. I wasn't able to chase after them after they left the stop. why cannot carry crowded bowl? dabao back to hall to eat cannot meh Thx bud, I will have a look on that. Dollar for dollar matching is quite amazing. Oh i see Lol I think he was making a pun"
Missed EVERY Orientation ,"hi idk this is just a rant but I could use some help
I'm an ib student that got my offer super late, my flight to Singapore is in two hours and im gonna reach Sunday night, and classes start from monday I'm freaking out idk how to navigate the place and do things i don't have the matriculation card are they even gonna let me in??? Basically ik I'm being stupid but everything is just really unfamiliar and daunting please PLEASE if someone is in the same boat lmk so we can figure this out tgt
 Matric card not needed to enter campus or anything, navigation can be tough but you can search NTU maps on google and type in your venues (I still got lost and was late for 30 mins on my first tutorial tho lol, but honestly no one cares)

First week usually most profs start with like intro to module etc, and esp y1 the profs may talk about adjusting to uni life so dw! refer to the ntu campus map online for your class locations, you dont need your matric card, dont worry everyone is gonna be late in week 1 Don't stress, things are pretty straight-forward LOL. I was an exchange student who arrived in Singapore 1 month after class started and I got around just fine. The campus is not different from any other place, just use Google Maps. There are also maps all around the campus or you can look up online [https://maps.ntu.edu.sg/](https://maps.ntu.edu.sg/), then just walk or take the shuttle bus (it's free). If you get lost just ask for help, people are friendly! Don't hesitate to ask for help. Everyone on the campus  is ,or was ,in the same boat. They ll help u out. i rcently got the offer as well! i didnt attend ANY orientation!!!! but ur good to go :"") ive yet to explore the campus more as ive only been thr once Most of my good friends I‚Äôve made outside Y1 orientation. You may feel lonely at the start since many people now have cliques from orientation, but it will be fine! Just be approachable and talk to people here and there in classes, join hall committees/CCAs if you are in one. If not, there‚Äôs also orientation next year you can join! Even as a senior you‚Äôll be making friends.

As for getting around, it‚Äôs normal to be lost in week 1. Even till this day as a Y4 I struggle to find classrooms. But you‚Äôll figure it out, once you find out where the classes are, you just need to go to the same places every week so its not too bad download ntu omnibus! it‚Äôs our shuttle bus app & it shows the timings of the shuttle buses as well as the routes. It's pretty easy to navigate the campus with the app and don't worry too much have fun also events are happening on the first week in school so I guess you can try to talk to new people as well. Enjoy and don't stress :) heyy what course do you do? maybe i can get my friend to help find a buddy! tysm this rlly called my nerves tysm! I'm in econ! heyy my friend's in econs maybe she can help you? dm me your insta id! i can ask her to help"
"Missed out on hall orientation, unsure how to make friends in hall now","I (21F) signed up for hall but fell sick and missed the whole 3 days ü´† It‚Äôs my first day here at my hall, I just moved this past weekend. Was walking around my block, noticed people were visiting each other. I feel so sad cus I missed out on ori, now don‚Äôt have any friends in hall, and idk how to make close friends in hall. I smile and say hi to people I see but that‚Äôs it lol idk how to take it further. I‚Äôm worried I won‚Äôt have the ‚Äúhall experience‚Äù - visiting, hanging out, etc. Does anyone have any advice? Tbh feel pretty lonely especially since my roomie hasnt arrived yet. :(  Join hall cca Hi no worries! Do come for hall events and try to mingle! I know it's daunting but if you vibe well, you'll definitely sit with them comfortably. No pressure on yourself! You'll also find hall friends in your faculty too :) Maybe it's just me, but you didn't miss out on much. Lol Join hall events like rec games and sports. Which hall do you live in? Host a movie/netflix watch party and invite all your neighbours on your level to join. I didn‚Äôt go for any orientations (faculty and hall) either and I still made a whole bunch of friends from different blocks. Its been 6 years since I graduated and we still keep in touch! What hall? just join a room. we friendly one!!!!!! Do join the hall ccas!! They are a great way to make friends in hall :) I did join hall orientation when I was a freshie but I just didn‚Äôt vibe with people from my OG. Btw my hall orientation was online back in covid era. All of my friends in hall I got to know them from hall ccas. Since there are intensive training before the IHRG/IHG, that‚Äôs where we bonded the most RIP inbox. 18f here having the same experience, what hall ru in? Just my experience. I went to stay in a hall with my secondary school friend as roommate, we'd travelled and stayed together before so it wouldn't have been an issue. My roommate said he wasn't gonna go hall orientation because his not that social, not wanting to go alone, didn't go either. In hindsight this shouldn't have been a factor considering I went for my faculty/school orientation where I didn't know anyone either.
So I did regret not going. Over the years I did try bonding with other hall people joining events, Hall halloween horror night, night cycling, I was even captain of a sports CCA for a year. But I never really felt like I belonged with my hall. I guess what I'm saying is sometimes you can try your best to make friends, but sometimes it doesn't happen. That doesn't mean you don't try though, just to set your expectations because sometimes it doesn't work out and it's not anyone's fault. Which hall r u in Psh nobody needs friends Dude, it‚Äôs a building full of kids your age, shouldn‚Äôt be hard to make friends, go get yourself out there THIS lmao im in banyan and its a ghosttown früòî i regret not gg ori How do you join/sign up for hall ccas? wait same 23f which hall r u in Usually there will be a hall cca fair during your hall‚Äôs freshmen welcome dinner (sem 1 week 1 or 2), u can visit the various cca booth, learn more about them (training timings etc) and sign up with them."
Monkeys entering my room through the windows,"I live in crescent hall and there has been 2 occasions where my room was ransacked from the inside by monkeys while I was at lectures. The first time they took half my biscuits the second time all my oreos.

Do yall close the windows when you are out and at night? I live in no ac room so closing the windows at night is very hot. How do I prevent monkeys from stealing all my stuff? Don‚Äôt let the monkeys know your next move. Steal their stuff instead üòâ I always climb up the trees to steal their bananas, don‚Äôt let them raid your base, raid theirs Welcome to NTU! Buy some sort of rod or stick? to put horizontally on the window sill so that can jam the insect nets.

But tbh rly should close your windows if you‚Äôre away for v long cos if rain your room gonna flood stayed in crescent last ay, monkey issue isn‚Äôt that prevalent at night so i leave my windows open at night but other than that, my windows are always closed when im not in the room How could they do that!?! 
This is war.
Next time you want party for a raid, ons. My hall windows had two layers. 1 is the usual glass one. The other is a mesh type. When I open the glass one, I leave the mesh one locked so no wildlife (birds/monkeys/snakes) can come in. 

Context: my old hall was right next to a forested area....I've had birds going crazy and slapping at my window before. I also hear the rooster crows in the morning.. and the hogs fighting at night... Hmm maybe you should keep it closed for an extended period. Once they managed to get food from your place they could build a habit to keep coming back.

I used to put a bucket containing waste in the kitchen before. And these Mynars kept coming back. Until I got pissed and put a cover on it till they gave up. Are you sure it wasn‚Äôt alumni looking to expand their underwear collection? So cute. My child used to stay at Pioneer Hall. He didn‚Äôt mention about monkeys and I didn‚Äôt see monkeys when I went there. What blk?? I'm in crescent too üò≠ When you‚Äôre out, keep the windows close(and I mean by latching/locking it). I know room will be stuffy, so open the ventilation panel and fan on. 

From my experience, monkey never came in at night. Crescent hall might be the best hall in ntu ü•πü§® Monkeys sleep at night - no worries to leave open at night.

Daytime, should close windows if not around. Monkeys have now learnt your room has food, they will keep coming back. Isn‚Äôt there some kind of a metallic mosquito netting at the window? Bruhh which floor was this? Report to housing office or NParks. Those things happened before, NParks came to remove the monkeys, but the monkeys returned. bro you cant call Indians and Malays that anymore... I agree monkeys broke in my room by destroying the mesh"
NTU BUS IS SIMPLY NOT IT,"The buses and the frequency of them arriving is simply incapable of transporting everyone safely and efficiently.

When it rains‚Ä¶ it is the end  First picture looks like clubbing I have given up most times and if the bus dont come in 5 mins I turn and walk across NTU frm norther than north spine to gaia or SS for classes. I think its faster anyways cos my stop always no space to even get in What is the NTUSU doing? Oh wait..nvm World class institution with 3rd world problems it is insane which nightclub is this? 565 Hopefully it gets btr aft recess wk i already give up on the bus, i just walk everywher Ambatukam !!! Average SBS bus enjoyer: ü•± Then what is? Haha Agree What is bus? The number of tourists in the bus ain‚Äôt helping too :‚Äô) if class ends at 5:30pm might as well study and have dinner before going home Comfort Del Gro  got to wake up. The timing during lunch period is also horrible for Blue Bus. Especially around 1:30-1:45pm bus is terminating at Northhill. Yesterday was horrible I almost cried‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt get my head around how all Singaporeans are so chill about situations like this‚Ä¶  in my home country we would strike and scream at the people responsible. Yeah, you guys who just want to get around campus should buy bikes ü§£ Same hereee... 3 consecutive buses all full with people packed like sardines, no one even alights at my stop What is NTUSU? It exists? It will never get better :'( 61% voted for their government & enjoy ""suffering"" in many forms & still smile about it....hahaha.. Japanese invasion of Singapore throwbacks? When the exchange student and tourist leave the crowd shld get smaller abit I mean, I hope the context is a little different. 

But seriously though, if you're just travelling between dorm and class, a bike seems a much better option than walking or fighting for bus space. I know NTU should fix the problem and add more busses, but until they do, it seems better than waiting 45 mins + for a bus. Broooo 45mins?! no bus provider has any excuse being that inefficient ü§° Haha that's what one of the other posts about yesterday said. I know last night I waited 30 and saw two come through that only got maybe 10 people on max, with like 40ppl waiting. I gave up and got a grab."
NTU Hall Information AY2024-25 Edition," Would be massively insightful if you could add more details apart from the strong emphasis on hall games/sports such as availability of lifts, accessibility of facilities or approx time taken to reach school by bus/walking, any ongoing construction or noise pollutant etc. Nonetheless it's a pretty informative infographic! You made this? Hall 7 is also one of the newest hall(Saraca cluster) Crescent Hall IChess isn't that strong actually. It seems like OP just pulled results from IHRG/IHG and found the best placing to plug into the infographic.

Regardless, this is still impressive work, props to OP How old is hall 14? Hmm no one talking about hall 9 culture >hall 15

>strong contract bridge team

pick one lmao i just moved into hall 2, who do i speak to to join in sports and rec games (although i am terrible in all of them)

also if i want to play some dodgeball is there any group that does that? (i like to assault people with my balls) fml come out until so late Yup Yes you‚Äôre right, it used to be near south spine but it got moved to Nanyang Crescent 23 years old Nice! The distance is via Maps right? Yes its from Google Maps"
NTU Qs ranking went up to 15thÔºÅ,"What‚Äôs ur thoughts? **Cos they reject me for bachelor, that‚Äôs why the previous year drop, now they accept for my master so it went up /S**

![gif](giphy|u0LxmF9QVeDoQ) Damn, new pres been only here a year and we went from 26th to 15th.¬† Princeton and Yale at 22 and 23 should tell you all you need to know about the usefulness of this ranking system Honestly, practicality aside, (not looking at employer reputation and all the important metrics for undergrads) I think this is great. Never been more proud to be in ntu than I am now :‚Äù) Let‚Äôs try to look at the positives too. Had just submitted my FYP, coincidence? Probably, but there‚Äôs a chance [deleted] We had 38k PSLE students in 2023.

NTU gets roughly 6k freshies yearly.

NUS gets roughly 7.5k freshies yearly.

This is around 35% of the annual student intake, never mind other unis.

NUS and NTU are ranked 9th and 35th in employability.

For reference, Tsinghua and Peking from China are 14th and 21th.

In reality, we're already getting boosted wayyyyy hard. If the ranking becomes the goal, the ranking loses its value. THE is another ranking to look out for. I believe NTU is ranked higher on that. But both QS and THE uses criterias that may or may not be too relevant depending on the individual. Means jack shit. Honestly thought NUS was the best we could possibly have, didn't expect NTU to show how good they can also be. This university is aü§¨ so no surprise.üôÇ Engineering students that are mass manufactured, only can do TYS. ![gif](giphy|Bj5ILhCPm8EQ8) Didn't realize you were chill like that The old president introduced icc ü§¢ That sarcasm or what? [deleted] Are you an intl or local applicant? 21st not 21th Remove ICC +5 rank¬† Most students realistically only care about undergraduate teaching and opportunities. Those two schools offer way more than NUS and NTU could. The rankings really only apply to research quality but for the average student it's all fluff. (First I agree that QS ranking isn't meaningful.) I don't think what NTU has done with buying researchers can make NTU rank higher than Princeton.

For research, one should check Shanghai Ranking (https://www.shanghairanking.com/), which is purely research-based. Now you see NTU goes down from 81st in 2021 to 93rd in 2023, while Princeton stays at 6th stably. thats weird, our employment numbers are fine, no? [deleted] I'm boosted ü§´üßè‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è True. Universities also want more international students as they pay more schl fees -> more research funding -> more research results -> higher uni ranking -> more international students hmm true that This ranking is skewed towards unis that have med schools as med schools churn out tons of research paper every year Yeah for nus and ntu they are more selective towards internationals since there's a quota I'm also an intl applicant but applying with us high school diploma To add on, as a student you'd want to pay attention to the academic and employer reputation metric instead. Going by those two, NTU would be at rank 42 and 92, which isn't quite ideal imo Do you mean QS or Shanghai ranking? Princeton doesn't have a medical school. [deleted] To add on\^2, sorting by academic subjects is valid, too. Some schools are strong at certain subjects and weak at others. Such is the case of NTU Engineering disciplines, which sit comfortably in the top 10 every year. Wait how do you know it's 50, and what are the quotas for other countries? The biggest attraction is govt subsidy for school fees ngl üëÄ"
Need help - annoying roommate during exchange ,"NTU paired me with another NTU student during overseas exchange and they‚Äôve been making my life miserable throughout the whole of exchange.

This girl constantly left period blood on the toilet seat, left me in the hostel room with a clogged toilet filled with her üí© before which I had to deal with, and has extremely terrible body odour.

But I put up with her for months because it‚Äôs difficult to swap my roommate.

This is the part I need help with - 
When NTU assigned the hostel fees, it was split evenly between us, and written down in text too.

However, this mf checked out 1.5 days early without telling me, and she‚Äôs expecting me to PAY HER BACK for the TWO days üíÄüíÄ (for context: it‚Äôs Europe so it‚Äôs almost $180 SGD‚Ä¶.)

The admin staff during exchange and my friends told me to ignore her because I don‚Äôt have an obligation to pay her back, but she‚Äôs been spamming me everywhere and borderline being harassing. (She found my NTU email on the NTU registry too after I ignored her texts) 

After one month, she got NTU involved to ‚Äúmediate‚Äù instead of letting the issue go.

Is this her being cheapo, or is this issue my fault? Why tf did I get a roommate like this? shes borderline insane She should be paying YOU the $180 instead for dealing with her üí© (literally too) well honestly just ignore her - she can't really do anything Just ask the hostel to confirm that obviously rooms are paid for for the entire term regardless of when specifically a student leaves. It's not like they can source a random person to stay in her room for those two days.

Send this in writing to NTU and tell them case closed. Send her an itemised bill for your plumbing and cleaning services. If shes being cheap you can go even cheaper what would happen if you ignored the emails from NTU admin though? 

Like, say that it was understood that she needed to pay half the fees for the room regardless of how often she used it. I.e., even if you were out partying the entire exchange and have never seen your room, if the administrators were not informed, then you would still obligated to pay because they left the room empty for you. In a similar sense, if she were to leave ahead of time, the onus is on her to inform the admin staff of her decision and negotiate the excess days worth of boarding fees. 

This has nothing to do with you. Inform NTU of ^ and tell them you will not entertain further emails on the issue. You can gently suggest that NTU can negotiate with the admin staff on behalf of your room mate if they are so invested in this issue, but that you want no part in this because you have already paid your fair share. Go big and file police report against her for harassment Zip everything up and send it to NTU to lodge a formal complain, idk if it will achieve anything, but might as well let the school know of her unbecoming conduct. The school is always afraid of problems and scandals. So you just need to make it a bigger issue. Tell the school that you want to
1) submit a formal complaint to the school for harassment 
2) make a formal report against the student for online bullying/harassment 
3) go public with this 

Get all the evidence you have and send it to ntu You need to collect a bucket of your period blood and shit and then dump it on her one day. That will show her who‚Äôs boss. Tell her this: ‚Äúafter you check out, do I have two bodies to sleep on your half of the room? Then why do I have to pay for your half?‚Äù But what‚Äôs NTU‚Äôs view on this? Regardless of the context, moving out early is on her. If she wants the SGD180, it should be refunded from the hostel operator, no? Was there a signed agreement; if yes, what does it say? Cite Act 17 of 2014 to NTU and say you'll report her to police for harassment under that act if the school decides to continue intervening for 'peaceful mediation' Don‚Äôt be shy, share her email address we know what to do üòÄ Why do locals have such a hard time standing up for themselves? Just read the agreement, if there is one, and then stand up for your damn rights. Yes, threatening her with reporting to police for harressment would be best. With a report, she would have trouble coming back to SG. Let her know. You are a better person than me fr. Wouldve dropped her name, number, email address and the whole tea (i assume you went thru alot) Not from NTU but she is literally harassing you. You should take screenshots of her spam emails and messages and maybe lodge a complain so maybe it will give her less legitimacy with this whole hounding you for money thing Where she from? Local? Nasty girl im sorry u had to go through that ... but im curious bc im going on exchange next sem, ntu will pair u up with another student for the hostel? or is this something u have to sign up for? DOCUMENT EVERYTHING.
Put her on spam mail.
Get NTU to mediate. If what the admin staff said is indeed true that you don't have to pay her back, then document everything, and file a case with the police Is she Indian? [deleted] Is she brown ? Your borderline and my borderline as far as Woodlands checkpoint and KL. I‚Äôve been doing that for weeks but she got the school involved and now the school is sending me texts and emails üíÄ Thank you. I just told NTU this, but their response was that I have to directly negotiate with her instead of ignoring her üò™ Yup Chinese üòÇ also NBS üòÇ pay me $180 and i‚Äôll never appear infront of you What‚Äôs the school saying? Lol, look at NTU offloading their work to you. I think you're too soft on this.

What can she do except harass NTU if you decide to ignore her and direct all emails from her to the spam folder? File small claims for $180? Then again, what can NTU do if you decide to let them make the executive decision of whether to disengage this psycho instead of you taking the heat for them?

I would have ignored all emails on the issue after sharing my side of the story. You are 100% in the right. This is up to the psycho to negotiate with the admin of your shared room and for NTU to step in if they feel the need to. You have no skin in the game. That‚Äôs crazy, just ignore the admin. Scary if such people take leadership roles in the future. local or prc? They want to call us both to settle a ‚Äúpeaceful conclusion‚Äù but I told them firmly that I‚Äôm not paying her back. But honestly what a waste of time‚Ä¶ I think you need to go on the offensive. Tell the school that you are formally lodging a complaint against her for harassment, and ask the school what are they going to do about that. There is a code of conduct that students need to adhere to, and the school also has the obligation to protect its students. If they try to downplay your concerns, threaten to lodge a police report. Damn your room mate really said

New FGO isn‚Äôt actually as great as it first looks,"For a policy that supposed to ‚Äúencourage students not to be too focused on grades‚Äù, it doesn‚Äôt actually make too much of a difference 

The only obvious benefit this has brought about is that we are now able to view our grades before deciding to Pass/Fail it. However, this applies to BDEs only. Basically no change from what it was in the past, except we can see our grades first before deciding. (In the past, some profs would be nice enough to give u a rough idea of your grade range anyways so this isn‚Äôt really a big thing imo)

MPE-BDEs can be FGO‚Äôd, yes, but it means that the MPE is now considered a BDE. So my BDE requirement count decreases but my MPE one stays the same. If I was taking this module as part of my MPE requirement, I would need to take another module to clear this requirement. 

So essentially, unlike NUS, we still cannot opt to Pass/Fail any core modules at all. Yes it is a small step in the right direction but it feels like this step is way too small. Thoughts?  There's a line between encouraging students to learn new things and destroying academic rigour. If we did what you said it's definitely leaning into destroying academic rigour part and this will have a lot of effects. Students can dgaf about core mods and barely pass. 

  
To my understanding NUS is very limited as well, to year 1 mods and year 2 mods without pre requisites (which is very few of them). I'm told their purpose was to offset the shock of coming into university. i don't understand the point of wanting to S/U core mods. it's called core for a reason -- graduates with that degree are supposed to have proficiency in topics that are core to their degrees. you don't wanna be an engineer with a D on engineering maths.



additionally, future core mods rely on earlier core mods as a prerequisite as they build on foundational knowledge taught in earlier core mods. if your foundations are terrible how are you going to do well on the future core mods?


this FGO would've been so helpful, as i took a linguistics mod but had to S/U since i wasn't sure i did all that well -- if i knew i had an A or maybe an A- i wouldn't have S/U'ed it lmao Just waiting for the Fate Grand Order memes to start Say reals best improvement they can make is to make ICC included with FGO Oooo I didn‚Äôt realise about the MPE is taken as BDE part

![gif](giphy|7SF5scGB2AFrgsXP63|downsized) Here's another benefit:
1. Take BDEs until you clear all BDE AUs required for graduation
2. Apply for BDE overload until your Academic Office hates you
3. Instantly FGO 12AUs of MPE so they turn into another 12AUs of BDE, and take 12AUs of MPE to compensate
4. You have successfully scammed NTU into giving you a ton of BDE AUs Does it apply for this sem bde? Can I convert my MPEs to BDEs to S/U it? ‚Äú‚Ä¶isn‚Äôt as great as it first looks‚Äù are you a dedicated hater or something? Being able to S/U while knowing your grades is a massive W, and you understating this benefit is not productive. What was the whole point of this post? To add balance to people praising the FGO? As an alumni myself, I WISH we had this over what NUS currently has so it really does beg the question what is your intention with this post OP?

Your tag is ‚ÄúBusComplaintGuy‚Äù and looking through your Reddit history, it really does seem like you‚Äôre just a hater who stokes fires instead of providing solutions to solve them. Cannot s/u core mod :/ give you one cm you want one meter... >Students can dgaf about core mods and barely pass

Meanwhile I gaf about core mods and barely pass I get your first point and i agree, but as u mentioned also, NUS allows that for earlier year mods, so why can‚Äôt NTU provide the same as well? 

In addition when students go for exchange in y3/y4, their credit transfer allows them to pass/fail their MPEs as well. Kinda pay to win in that sense That is all I can think about.

There is no Pity Counter here. i straight up thought ntu collabed with fgo or some shit This is legit how I found out other people in ntu play fgo 

We need a club fr and you can graduate half a year earlier :) Provided that MPE offers a BDE option. Look it up on STARS, but note that if you apply FGO on MPE-BDE mods, you need to take add mods to clear your MPE. If u S/U your MPE then u need to take another MPE and not S/U that one A step in the right direction tho?? We take those Ws >:D real The difference is that NUS has a slightly bigger tug on their grades. But i still kinda agree on keeping core mods without FGO. But if required, perhaps conditions can be adopted to making a max of 12aus core mods maximum unaffected GPA if failed instead of limiting that option to the first year alone. That way, you dont have S/U, sure, but I think academic oerformance cna still be prioritised anyway. And a fail could have the option of not being on transcript. That way its the best win.

Still, FGO is probably one og the biggest wins in at least a decade for NTU Exchange requires a few things. 1 a good GPA to begin with for certain university and 2. The ability to map certain mods.

More often than not you are unable to only map mods you can't score in and you can't choose A to not S/U while C, you S/U. So it's not really pay to win, it's a grind to reach there and having a rather even outcome. Friend code put here Did yall see summer tialoc, new summer bb and xx Don't we alr have a club for that ?? NTU VAS Summer Tialoc has my HEART"
New Flexible Grading Option (FGO),"The Flexible Grading Option allows a student to convert the grades of eligible courses to Pass or No Record grades, which are excluded from the student's cumulative GPA (CGPA). It will be effective from AY2024/25 and supersedes the existing S/U Option Policy.
 
The FGO aims to empower NTU students with greater autonomy and flexibility to shape their academic journey. Through the FGO, students are provided a safe space to try new courses, without having to worry about its potential impact on their CGPA. This encourages students not to be too focused on grades, but rather to seize every opportunity to stretch themselves and explore new areas outside their core discipline.

FGO allows students to convert the grades of eligible courses to Pass or No Record grades, which are excluded from the student's cumulative GPA (CGPA). 
 
Students can declare the FGO on eligible courses taken in any semester during any declaration period before their graduation, subject to the quota of FGO Academic Units (AU) for their degree programmes. 
 
After the FGO declaration, grades will be converted to Pass/Fail.

Following the declaration, students' CGPA for the latest semester will be recomputed to reflect the FGO-declared courses. Students will only receive AU for FGO-declared courses with Pass grades.

The FGO can be applied to up to 12 AUs for three-year, four-year degree programmes (except Biomedical Sciences) and five-year programmes, and up to 9 AUs for direct entry programmes and Biomedical Sciences programme.
 
The FGO can be applied to:

1. Broadening and Deepening Electives (BDE): Courses to broaden and deepen students' learning experience

2. Major Prescribed Electives offered with a BDE option (MPE-BDE): Selected courses that undergraduates can take for specialisation in a particular degree programme or to broaden your learning

Source: NTU Intranet

TLDR: We can now S/U up to 12 AUs after seeing our AY24/25 Sem 1 course results. However, eligible courses are limited to Broadening & Deepening Electives (BDEs) & Major Prescribed Electives (MPEs) with an BDE option.  It‚Äôs just the same SU policy of 12AUs, just that u get to see your BDE grades before you decide. But still isn‚Äôt as good as NUS which allows core or specs mods. However, we will take it still tho BDE only 15AUs‚Ä¶ At least now on par with NUS in terms of letter grading, now need allow core S/U. Freshies we hit the jackpot üî• An actual useful change. Thank you NTU üò≠ Damn, wish they had this when I was still a student haha Some good news! This is an actual improvement, please continue in this direction. So how many AU worth of mods allowed to FGO?

Edit: I have no access to intranet Can you SU a previous bde that you took before that you previously didnt SU? (eg a bde you took last year that's letter graded) For older students like myself, at least I can see my prev SU grades and decide if I wanna use FGO. But does it mean the sch will have to recalculate GPA for that sem if it turns out my grade is better than expected and I wanna revoke my prev SU, or will the improvement js be reflected in latest CGPA, abit confusing. but how about existing students who have expended some S/Us alr? is it refreshed or we stick to our balance spent 600 SQ on Arjuna but didnt get him :( Anyone knows how to verify if the MPEs have a BDE option? NUS students: üëÄ Can we retroactively SU a previous year mod? 

(Not convert a SU into a letter grade - iirc that doesn‚Äôt work for previous year mod) Lol for poly students it doesn't help So we can‚Äôt FGO MPEs, only BDEs? cant believe fate is collabing with ntu Just confused, can FGO be used by current Y4 students retrospectively? So like say someone graduating this year wanted to S/U a BDE he/she took in Y2, can he do that? FGO the GOAT Hi does anyone know with this new system, can I FGO my minor mods (up to 6 AUs)? So it works for this current semester bdes too? applies the same way to 2nd major/minor mods? It's better in the sense that we can wait till final year to do it. IIRC NUS must do it before the next sem. All in all, we take it, it's definitely an improvement over the old system. The thing about getting it after results was the main thing. NUS SU is also heavily restricted to y1 mods or y2 mods without pre-reqs. actually i like our system better bc (correct me if i‚Äôm wrong) NUS SUs only apply to mods without prerequisites, so while they can SU the ‚Äúlowest level‚Äù core mods, they can‚Äôt really SU their 3k/4k mods. the MPE-BDE thing sounds rlly promising bc it sounds like we can SU mods that have prerequisites even tho they‚Äôre not cores, so these include 3k/4k mods?

like for eg i‚Äôm doing a bunch of 3k mods this sem as BDEs which is SU-able in NTU but won‚Äôt be in NUS 12AU given for 4 years One moment read as fate grand order lol.

  
9 to 12 AU depending on course btw https://preview.redd.it/ysijx5mvjbld1.png?width=1178&format=png&auto=webp&s=ebb0827e915e4901da8c01c0037546996d8a5e28

From the FAQ document, seems like you will be able to! I think the transceipt for that sem will be updated, and the CGPA computations will also be updated for all semesters thereafter? Coz i doubt theyd bother to be so petty to show in any way that 'this student undid their SU mad late to save their butts' to employers whod want transcript. 

If this is to enhance our grades, surely theyd want it all to look consistent. They want everyone to get jobs easier for their stats after all. If you decide to change and not S/U past grades then they will ‚Äúreturn‚Äù back what you have used. But if you decide to not change and continue S/U past grades then you will stick to your balance. But just to clarify, to fulfil specs requirement, it has to be taken as MPE and not using BDE. Hence you cannot use this FGO to clear specs mod to make it pass fail. It only allows student from other courses to take your specs mod as BDE. https://preview.redd.it/q1g3gbnndbld1.jpeg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f551dfd890c2d976f24547b9b30ee8ff2bd9f5af

This module is a core module for me. But at the top it says ‚Äúavailable as a BDE‚Äù. You can find this where you find the schedule for the indexes of the modules in NTU Stars

I am bummed they don‚Äôt allow S/U of CC mods though. So it‚Äôs a tiny modification but not anything major. Can

https://preview.redd.it/eh0urfc6adld1.png?width=1178&format=png&auto=webp&s=10a8efc24dbf1921371ca14235ee872a65a0ee0b Idts, it's only usable on mods you alr S/Ued before, just that they show you the letter grade and let you choose whether you want to un-S/U it Yeah so your GPA can still improve alittle after declaring it in final year since all BDE AUs should have been taken at that point. But ig like u said, it‚Äôs an improvement. Yeah i know, but i think some people are glorifying alittle much https://preview.redd.it/g5h0xt0plbld1.jpeg?width=1044&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f91881c3457c1f0980911d1389f4ab260257fba7

But then if you use FGO for those MPE-BDE mods, it will automatically be taken as BDE instead of MPE. So it means you still need to take additional of your major mods to clear under MPE so it isn‚Äôt exactly useful So same thing 9 for DY2? https://preview.redd.it/elnpkzjvkbld1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f4d834cf37f1d1c1d0d021f64f5a9a7debbd3de5

I guess I answered my own question thank you:) thank you!! In the email it says:

""There is no rush to make your FGO declaration at the end of each semester. You can wait until your final year to decide and make your FGO declarations.""

""Students may submit their FGO declarations within a stipulated period after the release of examination results. The FGO can be applied to any eligible courses taken in any semester during any declaration period before their graduation. Once the FGO declaration is made, it cannot be reversed""

Does this mean you can retrospectively apply FGO to grades from the past you didn't S/U declare earlier? So if i need to take 6 MPEs to graduate (not for spec, just for grad) and i FGO 1 of them, means i need to take another MPE without FGO? Yeah and biomed Essentially, the re-calculations would be reflected in the latest sem's CGPA? Huh. Odd. But my bad for not looking it up. Oh oops, I just re-read the email, yeah you can, as long as you haven't hit the limit of 12AUs total yet Assuming that out of the 6MPE you did, the MPE you decided to apply for FGO has a BDE option, then yes, you need to take either another MPE that has no BDE option or MPE-BDE but don‚Äôt apply the FGO for graduation requirement. Biomed as in the TCM degree? yup I guess, I'm not fully sure myself so might have to ask my school if this is applicable for courses taken before FGO came out. It's possible it only applies to courses from this semester? I mean you cant FGO an MPE that isnt a BDE anyway, so basically means this change has done nothing except allow people to see their grades before FGOing BDEs This one idk And if you fail by chance it is not reflected on your transcript (no record), unlike the 'u' from before I think."
"Not a motivation propaganda, just a summary of 4 years here","I have recently graduated from computer science, it just seem so surreal that someone like me even got into uni and graduated. There are many post from others who is thinking of dropping out and feeling so lonely in such a crowded big uni. I was one of those post under a throwaway account.   
During entry into uni, it was still covid thus no physical orientation and heck, I even forgot about the online orientation date thus didn't attend. I wanted a fresh start and a nice interesting university life, it wasn't. I came from Business Information Technology diploma and assumed this degree would be similar, I was not prepared for the math so much that I failed both my math module in year 1 sem 1 even though math was my strong suit. I was utterly devastated and wanted to drop out. I still 'had' friends who would study after class for a few session but I just wasn't the study type like them so we drifted away. Ignoring the 2 failed math mod, I started my GPA at 4.0, looks impressive but spoiler alert, I graduated now at 3.02.   
For the next 2 semester, I no longer had friend in uni, I was in a toxic relationship and saw a semester GPA of 2.0, I was called to meet my mentor or whatever that role is (those we know, know how useless it is). I wrote a few post on throwaway account seeking help here in this subreddit, asking if anyone want to be friend or should I just drop out. I dont know how but I was just drifting through this period of time trying to stay afloat and not break my parent's dream of me graduating from a local university which is a first for my family.   
Over time during the next 2 years of uni, I was just constantly thinking of dropping out and feeling the wave of loneliness when I walk by north spine with everyone in groups or their friends chatting and having fun while I'm there, I'm right there beside everyone but the whole university felt like a ghost town to me.   
I slowly made the change to seek out new environment to be in, extend my network and get to know more people outside of uni. It was slowly getting better knowing this period of 'uni life' doesn't have to focus on uni. I hardly physically go to uni anymore and skip out on work while doing bare minimum and putting my hardest for group projects since I do not want to drag others even though I'm dragging myself down.   
Soon after it was internship which was a really great change of pace for me and then FYP came and I was glad my professor helped me throughout the way. Before I know it, I am now reading the email of application for convocation. I know I will be there with no friend from uni but I am doing it for myself and my parents to see me graduate.  
Hope one day for those who are struggling or feeling lonely in uni can push through too and somehow you are graduating as well.  Cs graduate too. Wasnt an easy journey, congrats to you. Honestly the loneliness in a big crowded environment prepares u for the workforce next time. Getting used to it and appreciating life outside of uni is the way to go So how's working life? Hey OP thanks for posting. Congrats on graduating! Not studying CS (can't imagine myself doing that, I think my brain will explode). I really relate with what you mean by it feeling so surreal for getting into uni, as it was not part of my plan to go to uni. There are a bunch of reasons but I won't bore you with the details. For the first time in my life, I experienced difficulty in connecting with people, mostly because I view myself as an outsider/ an outlier of the system (got in through ABA & igpa was barely at the 10th percentile). Suddenly I am surrounded by all these smart people. Honestly, I still feel alone most of the time, especially when people gave comments like ""its easy to get a B"", ""its only year 1"", without giving much empathy or help. I have learnt so much about myself for the past 1 year, especially how I have to be kind to myself (after what I have been through in my life) & that comparison is the thief of joy. I might not be able to graduate with an honours (really did tried but the competition plus my anxiety really got the best of me). Do you (or anyone reading this) have any advice for me on living my uni life to my fullest? Still have 3 more years to go & I intend to make a best of it!"
Outbreak of flu/COVID around NTU?,"Is it just me or are people around NTU getting sick lately? I got the flu last week and also noticed quite a few of my profs and classmates were also coughing/sick. Also starting to see some people/friends around my area getting sick in the past few days as well. Probably the fluctuation of hot weather and downpours Im sick too. But this happens every semester This stuff happens every semester I sometimes feel a sudden headache and it disappears after a night‚Äôs sleep. Someone told me that is because of Covid. i have a cough that wont go away since the start of the sem, i think school is the problem :( well there is mpox in sg now.... oh yea, i saw some people coughing and sneezing Congratulations, you‚Äôre not the only one *allergic* to school~

/s /j I had the flu last week  and I am still struggling to breath üòìüòì Just recovered from a cold the day before and crowdedness of campus buses, canteens and passages"
Petition for CCDS Academic Policy reversal ,"[https://chng.it/5phBygVCZ5](https://chng.it/5phBygVCZ5)

Title has described the points to be shared  Will be great if were to include the reinstatement of coursework grade retention policy That one is a bit more controversial and can be always be revisited later - it‚Äôs better to focus on the one specific policy that is taking effect and impacting students immediately Other schools dont have this tho. Like for example for cee if I dabao a mod I have to redo the quizzes even if I hit A for both quizzes > ii)                  Students were not informed before their course registration leading to suboptimal planning of their schedule

This is a ridiculous reason. It only means that students had decided not to attend courses or tutorials when they were registering courses. Is that a good attitude of learning? ??? Many students plan their timetables to minimize the amount of days to go school, in a suboptimal planning it means that students have to travel to school more to attend lessons. Thats why its ‚Äúsuboptimal‚Äù.  And with halls placement being extremely limited it is better to have a optimal timetable There‚Äôs really no reason to go for tutorials if there are online answers and you have no questions. You can skip tutorials and still score well You will only understand when you have to travel from east to pulau NTU for 1h tutorial that is going to be recorded just because of attendance. 3h+ travel time for 1h recorded tutorial. But it still reads like ""I registered this tutorial session but I don't plan to attend because I don't want to go to school on that day"". Still sounds like an attitude problem.

There are probably better reasons why the late introduction of this policy renders the existing timetables suboptimal, but the objection shouldn't read like an attitude problem. The current phrasing in this petition is bad. Oh, that's a good point about tutorials, but the complaint should really be that ""tutorials are too easy and there is no point in attending them"" instead of something that reads like an attitude problem. So, if this policy applies only to first- and second-year students, it'll be all right? I‚Äôm not saying that the tutorials are too easy. The reality is that people have different levels of experience with a mod‚Äôs material. Some may find the content easy or manageable, and others difficult. People who can understand the provided online solution may find it redundant to attend tutorial.

It doesn‚Äôt make sense to penalise or benefit students based on their attendance. Students should be assessed based on their actual understanding of the topic. Are you even a CCDS student or even a NTU student ? [deleted] He‚Äôs not even a CCDS student, some 30 year old dude based on his comments [deleted] I checked his comments history. He‚Äôs a prof"
Petition for NTU students traumatised by campus riders!,"Hello everyone, as everyone knows, the campus riders are straight SHIT. So here's a draft petition to hopefully improve the situation.

As students of NTU and/or that are paying school fees, we are rightfully entitled to convenience of transport with the campus riders. However, this is not the case. The bus stops are always full of people waiting for any campus shuttle, eventually potentially needing to give up on going up the bus because people are literally being squashed to the point the bus doors can barely close. The students are then left to watch as bus 179 arrives repeatedly while the bus stop gets even more crowded with people. Moreover, even with continuous feedback there have not been not any actions made to improve the situation of there not being enough buses to ferry the students around. 
Hence, considering the fact that there are students of 2 institutes of higher education that mostly rely on the campus riders to get around school, a suggestion made is to allow NTU & NIE students to ride buses 179 and 199 for free, or at a very discounted rate, through the use of the mateic card. This would allow students to get to their destination more quickly, solve the problem of the insufficient number of campus riders, as well as improve the welfare of the students by not forcing them to squeeze into the buses.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/NTU) if you have any questions or concerns.* Guy is deluded thinking 179 isnt as crowded as campus buses what‚Äôs worse is you managed to get into the bus and is squeezed among the crowd and when you want to alight, the bus driver doesn‚Äôt open the door or he just miss your stop. There was once i was in the bus and the driver literally went out to do something for like 5+ mins, leaving us to wait‚Ä¶. 179 and 199 are there for a reason no? Might as well ask for the MRT rides to be free from Jurong to Pioneer or Boon Lay ü§°

Or the taxi rides to be free too‚Ä¶ Smartest NTU student I‚Äôm with you on this‚Ä¶ except for the discounted rates for buses 179 and 199. How would they make it work for those 2 buses specifically. And also having to take those buses instead of waiting for campus riders isn‚Äôt a good reason for the school to subsidize your trip lmao

If there‚Äôs a way to petition/campaign (in some way) for more school buses during peak hours, I would be so on board. But at least it comes more frequently as compared to campus rider which cld help mitigate the crowd shee shee time They are nearly One way buses"
Please be considerate!,"To make the bus situation worse than it already is, many passengers on NTU buses are unfortunately inconsiderate and only think about scrolling through Â∞èÁ∫¢‰π¶ or TikTok. The 'full' buses are actually at ~70% capacity most of the time because of the blatant lack of initiative.

Dear fellow Singaporeans, this should already be automatic in a crowded bus. Please place your damn backpack on the floor and please move towards the end of the bus. Please!!!

Dear foreign friends, please try to take note of the conventions here in Singapore.

At this point, it seems like begging for more buses will never work. Perhaps, we can start by changing what we can control. Move-to-the-end-Michael Not just in NTU. Even in SBS buses and MRTs many ppl still refuse to place their bags on the ground. Many of these commuters will claim it's dirty lol. Ironically some of them have no issue putting their bags on the floor during class. And also touching the hand rails in buses/MRTs are also dirty according to that logic.

Just be considerate instead of worrying about this trivial issue. Not like you will get sick or smth. 555 [deleted] And create more tripping hazards! Get-out-giddion On top of that some people will just REFUSE to sit down at an available seat. Like why are people so adverse to sitting when the bus is packed to the brim üò≠ i always see packed 179s with an empty seat and it just feels so frustrating to see that during rush hour I just kiap between my legs and it rests on my ankles if that makes sense Just make sure it‚Äôs well tucked to your legs.. All the down votes for the actual truth üôÑ"
Poor state of hall ,"Recently moved into a different room in hall 2. Mind you I've been here for 2 years and this is the second time, I see a very bad situation with the toilets. The poor state of toilets and the general maintenance is ....man. there's stains on the floor you can't get off and despite of the hike in fees that you have to pay for supposed ""renovations and increasing charges"", no visible changes can be seen except the exterior paint. The toilet seats are sometimes broken, there's unremovable feces stain in the toilet, that looks so unhygienic you wouldn't want to use it at all. 
I'm a bit disappointed, maybe there could be better upgrade of toilet seats/ strong floor cleaning  or maybe I'm asking for too much, but I think some basic level of hygiene and maintenance existing when getting a new room would be highly appreciated. I sincerely hope they can improve the hall conditions even though it's an old hall, I think certain good renovations can be made ü•∫üôèüèΩ Anyone with similar experience with hall 2/1?  hall 2 is hands down one of the worst halls infrastructurally and culturally so glad i moved out after 1 sem ü§¢ I showed a vlog of someone moving into Hall 1 to my friend overseas and he said that it looks like one of those cheap motels on the roadside of India / Asia. I just moved in hall 1 and the toilet is horrendous cuz the other room that shared toilet with us puts her stuff everywhere and idk why there are four pairs of slippers when supposedly there should oni be 1 person staying in that room üôÄITS SO SUSSSS If you are still interested (though I'm going to the same hall as you) tmr I'll let you know :D"

Question to NTU students staying in Hall,"How often do they conduct SBB inspection in the dorms to check for contraband? And what are items i should prepare for the dorm? Bruh it's civilization already, no more SBA/SBB/SBU lol üíÄüíÄüíÄ helmet on, siao liao. 
 
Fyi no sbb. This uni not army You want SBB, can suggest to hall office. Here's a sample of how you can suggest: 

""Done by your hall's resident prof, every month need to do your room until swee swee, everything also clean until spotless. Hall committee's president need to diam the whole block and inspect each room for damages, dirt, dust etc. Punishment for not doing so can include having to do Corrective Work Order (clean the common hall areas) or clean the block over the weekend (with whoever else deemed living in poorly maintained, unhygienic conditions) under supervision. Repeated failure to heed warnings can result in escalation to School admin office, need to march from hall room to the NTU President's residence, can be evicted from hall as a result.""

PS: the above is 100% for satire, we're adults, you do yours I do mine, you want to be dirty up to you, just make sure you don't affect your roommate can already (esp in double room). Else, prep for a hell of a year. On top of that, since you enjoy SAF-style of life so much, I think can follow 9th core value for whatever 'contraband' you smuggle in. 

If you do get caught however, it's actually ""good luck to you"". Never As long as you don‚Äôt get snitched on by your neighbours (kena complain for loud noise etc), the security guards/staff don‚Äôt care one.¬† i hope ypu get 0 points tekong ptsd? Everyday after breakfast before leave for school at 7am SBB will be conducted good bait Every 2 week got one SBU Ive had 2 fridges in my room, one not even allowed cos its too big, for the entire year, hall office has come in and told us multiple times we need to pay for both the fridges, we never did and they never said anything about it. Is the email they send every semester about fridges counted?

But yea, high chance, nope."
RIP Tama Korean,"What happened to our beloved tama Korean stall run by the cute Korean couple üòîüòî Big mistake then was to buy 2 hotplate meat from the old Korean stall... Portion meant for 2 although it costs 7+ Is there still cheese ramyeon :( was best food at ntu They changed it?? It still kinda tastes the same tho Still reeling from losing cai fan in can 2 historically accurate japan invading korea o7 this place is NOT IT i bought food during orientation and the meat was uncooked like not even undercooked but straight up taken out of the kbbq bar type shi No more Korean food at Tama? ü•≤ Is there still cheese chicken?? :( damn The only good food in NTU is goneeeeeeee I saw they closed during summer intern when I was staying in hall. I will not find other Korean food I enjoy in SG anymore Korean food taste bad. They all taste like chemical spices. Ramyeon, yes. As for the cheese I‚Äôm not too sure because I‚Äôve only been back there once. Also the price for the ramyeon seems to be higher The way the aunty say cheese ramyeon was soooo cute:( It was on the slightly pricier side, but portions were HUGE. I honestly found it sad (and surprised) that they were replaced with another vendor because the aunty was super nice to me Yeah‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a different vendor now. I tried the kimchi fried rice which was mushy and tasted different to me. Prices are generally higher too As far as I can remember, I don‚Äôt recall seeing cheese on their menu Try Cha Re Re, they‚Äôre trying to get into NTU! I agree, it's hard to find a good Korean restaurant in Singapore that tastes as good as in Korea.

But it's to be expected I guess the aunty was so nice and always spoke korean to me. miss her I think Noodle Star K at tanjong pagar is pretty good! it's abit pricier (20+$) but worth it imo. go tanglin mall, there's a popup until 20th which got good food I rather not eat fake korean food than eat shit tier korean food. 

Not having good korean food is not a good excuse to settle for less. It just shows theres a demand for crap and so no need to do it well. Thanks for the recom, will go there sooner or later Do you have a link? Thanks! Probably because people haven't tasted good Korean food before. That's why they settle for less.

They don't know what they don't know not really, just Google search Tanglin Mall, it's a 5 min walk from Orchard Blvd MRT on Brown line, go to MarketBlue at B1 in the mall. It's called Seoul Noodle Shop. Recommend getting the kimchi pancake and perilla noodles. In this case its not even about the food tasting less than ideal. It straights up taste bad. And people are willing to pay 10 dollars for that shite ü§£ Seoul noodle shop, thanks a lot! My Google searches were only coming up with market blue"
Reading room manners,"Just had 2 girls bringing their food into reading room last night.

Reading rooms don't really have good ventilation so the smell stuck all the way to 2am.

Y'all, please have manners ok? Don't do non sensical stuff like this (unless the big sign saying no eating and drinking mean nothing to you). Did you tell them or you just rant here Which reading room was this? Had similar encounter at tama rr a certain rr had people grilling cheese sandwiches inside before ""Sorry to bother you guys but pls don't eat in here, the smell will linger you feel?üòä""

""Okok""

Done. why didn‚Äôt you just let them know it‚Äôs not ok to eat instead of ranting here?  You can always remind them of the sign. They hungry ~~ghosts~~girls la, hahaha~ They dont understand social etiquette and English. Have to speak down to them like how the CCP does and in mandarin. LMAO. If OP tells the person off, he/she is a ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù. Maybe if OP is a security guard, hall admin or prof still can. Chances are, OP would be talked about and gossiped, then, ostracised. Seems like we all know the answer Think you‚Äôre just making assumptions here, and generalising about a whole population. Its true what no its not, not generalising the whole population based on a select few that are bad Agree with u here, not all the so called PRC‚Äôs are bad, so far the PRC friends I made in NTU are all well mannered. Generalising an entire demographic is just plain narrow minded"

Roaming Christian duos are back again ,"Some of yall may remember my previous post about this awhile back: https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/pdjfJjLJN7

Well, guess what? Every single day I've been in school since this semester started, I have been approached at least once by these people again. 

That's genuinely fking CRAZY. HOW HARD ARE THESE PEOPLE HUNTING??? I'm getting approached literally every single day!

If you belong to any christian society or bible study group that is an NTU club, and you know members who are doing this, REIN THEM IN. This isn't the proper way to perform any form of outreach, and I say that while being a Christian myself.

Just 5 minutes before posting this, I got approached by another girl who called herself Eileen who tried to tell me about the same stuff, so I just cut her off and told her that I know what she's gonna say, and I am already a Christian and have my own care group.

I just want my quiet time during lunch and my study time to be uninterrupted. I hate explaining everyday to random strangers that, yes, I'm already a christian, and no, I do not need a bible study group. 

EDIT: BROOOO I GOT APPROACHED AGAIN. THAT IS TWICE WITHIN A 30 MINUTE PERIOD. STOP THIS NONSENSE.  I got approached by them yesterday üòÇ at the arc They probably literally think people will go to hell forever if they don't convert. (I'm also a Christian) My go-to tactic to fend off these folks is to introduce them to satanism. They give me odd looks of course but the more I sell it to them, the more conflicted they seem. Are they even from NTU? If you think about it, people from nearby churches (or any organisation) can just come in and start harrassing people. This is an educational institution and not the place to do so. Beggars whether Christians or not are abundant. Ignore them. Walk on - Jonny Walker. Where did this happen Douse them with holy water You need holy water i got some from Lourdes Have you ever found out where they are from? Honestly, I'll just reply them that I'm part of the Church...

The Church of Unitology.

Altman be praised. I pray to run into these people in school but it never happens to me Should've called campus security when they approached me back then .-. Saw one guy talking really really fast and loud in Chinese during the summer program. Outside the NS mall. 

I'm actually not opposed to getting to meet one of them, if only in the interests of debating them. Man, I hope they approach me. I have great things to tell them about Islam. I am a Christian, remember when my Buddhist friend came to me and asked me how to stop the people trying to sell him Jesus. This kind of 'evangelism' just puts people off. are they mormons? Im sorry but someone has to tell you this. You have a face that needs Jesus

 ^^/s I guess Eileen wasn‚Äôt a looker ‚Ä¶ I guess you could say they are preachy yuh ;p yes that's so f annoying Weird, honestly try to ignore them. Could they be related to the Bible Studies and Sunday Services Paul guy? I see his posters around NTU and they're lowkey offensive.

  
Maybe file a complaint to NTU? Forreal the have ya found jesus spam makes me feel like theyre searching for waldo instead. Call police. Evangelizing in the street is illegal. They will check CCTV and identify these persons. Just give them the death stare / extremely irritated look and walk extremely fast past like you're in a hurry to somewhere, and never take out your headphones if you're wearing any of course, absolutely gotta pretend like you never heard a single word. Seems to work for me. I feel kind of relieved seeing this post, as I didn't know if maybe I was too grumpy about being approached by these people so frequently. I felt like a magnet for this people üòÇ I try to tell them I'm not interested politely, but they don't seem to understand. :/ If they say you will go hell for not converting, ask them if they are threatening you with a good time Luke 9:50 NIV
""Do not stop him."" Jesus said. ""For whoever is not against you is for you.""

Matthew 10:40 NIV
""Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.""

Hope these verses will help you be more tolerant of others. You have to understand their pov. They think people  will go to hell (permanent) if they dont convert. To them they are legitinately trying to save people and so the best course of action is to go around and spread the gospel. End of the day you have to ask yourself the question of what if they are right and you are wrong? Genuinely curious if you read the Bible? That's what it says. You don't? You sure u are meh There are not, but, as you say, anybody can go in, so there is no way to kick them out. :c The most recent one just happened to me at NS, at the McDonald's seating area. Other than that, I keep getting approached in both SS and NS. Sorry to break it to you like this, but Lourdes water is not holy unless you got it blessed. Unfortunately, no Im more interested in what you‚Äôll do to them (I‚Äôve been a victim multiple times bro pls help) I wanna call campus security too, but then I think about all the hassle needed (call, wait for security, while also having to follow the people around to point them out to security), and I just give up lmao. 

Nowadays I just give them a very aggressive telling off, and then go back to what I'm doing. Unless they‚Äôre 2 white guys with white shirts, dark pants with ties and non-descript backpacks then no. Been seeing them roaming around in CCK lately. Even if she was a looker, i wldnt entertain her lmao.

Just last week, i entertained a guy who randomly approached me at the same Mcdonald's seating area I usually have lunch at, asking if I would be keen to answer a survey regarding entrepreneurs, and I had a very sincere and open talk with him.

These so-called ""christians"" feel more like a cult. The one time I asked where they were from, they said they were from some chinese society that i have never heard of. Ngl I always try to do that as my first line of defense (and me having earbuds plugged in + typing constantly on my keyboard shld alrdy indicate I'm busy and not free to talk) but they will still, like, bend down and get up into your face and force u to acknowledge them lmao.

In the second encounter I had today, one of the guys asked me if I was busy, to which I said ""yes"", and he still had the cheek to ask, ""can I just have a minute of ur time?"" or smthg LMAO. I could have said no, but I decided to hear him out just in case it was actually something important, like some NTU SU event they were advertising or smthg idk.

The moment he opened his mouth and he asked ""are you a christian?"" I just blew up in his face and told him off, telling him to stop interrupting students who were busy, that this was the second time today I had been approached regarding the exact same topic, and I had no patience to keep explaining that I already was a christian and had my own church and care group I belonged to. Maybe I'm blind but I haven't seen those posters before. Are there any around NS and SS? I'm abit curious what they look like. The problem is these people always approach me when I'm sitting down, and will literally bend down and get in my face even while im doing work with earphones in my ears. I can't go anywhere. 

Some even have the cheek to continue disturbing me even when I have already said I'm busy. Timothy 2:12 ""I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet.""

Matthew 6:5-6 ‚ÄúAnd when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing¬†in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.¬†But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father,¬†who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.""

Hope these verses will dissuade you from defending what the Bible evidently does not support. I am alrdy tolerant of others lmao. Quoting bible verses at a christian who goes to church regularly is one of the weirdest things u can do. 

There has to be a limit on how much u are supposed to tolerate. Is the bible asking u to just let people walk all over you? Absolutely not. Context is important, and bible verses quoted out of context mean absolutely nothing. It's like how we don't just go around committing sins, just because Jesus already died on the cross to forgive all our sins. 

These people I'm talking about in my post are a genuine stain on the christian faith. This isn't how u spread the gospel, and only serves to give christians a bad name. 

Moreover, some of these christians are basically harrassing other ppl. Others have recounted their own stories of these christian duos literally following them around campus even after being rejected, and the second duo I encountered today continued to harrass me even after I explicitly said I was busy.

If you unironically support such behaviour, then I apologise on behalf of the christian faith to other people reading this. Not all of us are like this. Then they have to think of other‚Äôs POV too eg: Buddhist, Muslim, Hindu faith. And then apply that last sentence to my counter argument. I disagree, there are much better ways to evangelise and spread the gospel especially nowadays where information is more accessible via online platforms. Even Jesus‚Äô disciples didn‚Äôt personally interrupt others when they were preaching, they did so at public forums where they would only engage in discourses with people who were willing to entertain them. 

Honestly, the best method of evangelising is to just commit to your religious practices and be charitable/giving to others. Once someone close to you feels intrigued enough to ask you about your faith, that‚Äôs when you can spread the gospel. Next time when you are having lunch you better be ready cause I'm gonna go preach the benefits of Satanism to you because in my pov I am right and you are wrong Okay but people (no offense) don't really care about engaging in the conversation.

Imagine you are eating your chicken rice and scrolling your phone and then someone comes along and starts rambling about the benefits of being vegan and you shouldn't be eating meat. Like tf?? And also there is the unpleasantness of being judged for doing ordinary things. and to that i‚Äôll quote marcus aurelius: Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by. If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones. Pascals wager is a fallacy. Apparently [SUTD students can call campus security to escort them out](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/kjTHovrKQk). We should do the same Mate, i got approached by 2 christian roamers (i think they probably from china or smth judging by their accent) also in front of subway. I think they normally target people who are sitting alone. Maybe have a friendly chat and ask where they go to‚Ä¶ which church‚Ä¶ and then tell them they are pissing people off. Ask!

I used to be from NTU CF but I would reckon it's more likely to be NTU CU (SORRY NO OFFENCE ITS TRUE) that might do this (no experience with Nav or Campus Crusade hahahha)

cus like, idk, NTU CU is the same umbrella ministry as NUS ReGen/SMUCF/SUTD CF and they're more reformed evangelical. I say this myself as someone who attends a church with many young adults in these ministries and where preaching is expository, but this kinda thing gives me a ""lemme teach you my Christianity is more correct than yours""

... which I think is quite prideful, but no one ever agrees with me on this - people just say, don't you think it's important to share what you know, good things with people ...

sometimes I feel like challenging back, what if in 2 decades you realise other people were more correct than you HAHA. It's not like they will say you are wrong, it's what I legit call ""more correct than you"" lol. Haha may I know how did you tell them off Yeah, if you look at the noticeboards, you'd see that they're actually everywhere NS, SS, HIVE, NBS, even the halls. 

I wrote to the school before about them, but I don't think they're from NTU since they're somehow always up.

Used to be a pigeon or something but now he's decided to hit people with the ""Then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many."" quote. I'm atheist so maybe that's why it rubs me the wrong way. What's a false prophet?

All scripture is God-breathed and useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness,

Luke 6:41-42  
""Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.""  
  
Wanting to encourage people to love others as God commanded shouldn't be seen as something negative. Why would God wish for us to hate each other?  
  
Mark 12:31 NIV  
""The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these.""

Regarding Matthew 6:5-6, I am merely trying to guide him on the right path. I do not deserve glory, nor do I seek or need it. What good can glory bring to me? I am a sinner, just like you, who can only be saved through grace alone.

You refuting what I have quoted simply because I wanted to help OP be more accepting of others shows that you do not love them.

Matthew 23:28 NIV  
In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.

Think of OP's attitude towards those preaching the gospel; all they wanted was to save people from destruction and yet he gave such an insensitive reply.

Me wanting to change his mindset towards preachers of the gospel should be seen as a positive change. Although he finds them annoying, I pray that he accepts them with open arms.

We may not be perfect, but we should strive towards living righteously.

Gonna quote this again:  
  
**Luke 9:50 NIV ""Do not stop him."" Jesus said. ""For whoever is not against you is for you.""**

**Matthew 10:40 NIV ""Anyone who welcomes you welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me.""**

Sorry if my rant is too long. He‚Äôs asking you to be more tolerant and you literally go full nuclear on him and question the foundations of his belief. I fully agree!

It's to be a good student/friend/staff/colleague then if your church is running an evangelistic talk or a Christmas/Easter service, just jio. People really will say yes one. Then after that it's up to the Trinity already

but on the human intervention front, really have people (non Christian contacts) whose response (to accepting an invite and turning up for a Christian event), is ""got free dinner and I'll try anything once, why not. Is it so hard to believe! lol""

So ya, that. HAHA. Its not. You cannot prove shit and thats the problem. Yah they do but they keep coming back hor. Lifehack you can ask them if you can take picture of them and they will leave you alone. Yea, at least some of these people are from some form of chinese christian society. I know this for a fact because some of them introduce themselves as coming from these societies. Lol CU mostly holds bible study in small TRs and I don't think they go around proselytizing unless the duos claim to be from there then I stand corrected. Depending on my current mood, my tone will range from curt to extremely passive aggressive, but my message will always be somewhere along the lines of, ""Yes, I am a christian, no, I do not want to join your bible study group. Please stop disturbing me"" (""please"" is also optional, depending on my mood). 

I noticed they always ask if I am a christian and if I wanna join their study group, so I just immediately preempt and shoot down. 

Today, because I was alrdy very tired from class, for the first person who approached me, I added the line, ""I don't think the students here appreciate you approaching and disturbing them out of the blue like this."" When the second encounter happened, I told the duo, ""This is the second encounter today already!"" If I'm not mistaken, the bible states that false prophets are those who spread false teachings while saying that they are teaching biblical truths. 

The first impression I get from this poster is a hint of fear-mongering. Not at all how christianity shld be spread. 

Not sure why this person puts his name and hp number there as well. Is this an actual church? A bible study school? A care group? A christian club? If he is from any type of christian organisation or social group, why is he using his own name to advertise? So many questions to ask, and such a suspicious ad ngl lmao. 2 Timothy 3:16 NIV  
*All* scripture is God-breathed and useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness

That means ALL of it. Not just the ones which you are cherry picking.

Matthew 23:28 NIV  
In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.

Think of your attitude towards people appearing righteous and preaching to others, but what they are actually doing is not what God would have wanted.

  
Luke 6:41-42  
""Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.""

  
Those wanting for people to better themselves, should first better *themselves* before preaching the Lord's word to others. This isn't even anywhere near nuclear lmao. I am simply pointing out the very huge logic holes in the points he is trying to make. 

He's asking me to be tolerant of people who are literally harrassing students. Absolutely not.

EDIT: in fact, I want you to point out where u think I am questioning the foundation of his beliefs. I just reread my entire comment and see nothing in there that directly says that what he believes is completely wrong.

Even my ""Jesus dying on the cross"" example is simply to prove that bible quotes taken out of context mean nothing. In the same vein, the Bible also states:

Timothy 2:12 ""I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet.""

Matthew 6:5-6 ‚ÄúAnd when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing¬†in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.¬†But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father,¬†who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.""

These false preachers shouldn't be defended. That's the problem between the scientific method and religion now, isn't it? You can't prove that God is real, but you also can't disprove it. Burden of proof lies on the one that makes the claim. I don't know lol.

The context (/timeframe) to my comment is that if I'm not wrong, when I was in NIE, there was no CU in NTU yet, only NIE CU.

Haha. But they're samesame butdifferent cos same umbrellaaaa. Yeah, ikr. Really sus tbh. I'm quite certain the people you mentioned are probably not NTU club members since the school keeps them on a pretty tight leash. So logically it can only lead to this guy, since he's been putting his posters up everywhere throughout the years that I'm in NTU. 

There was this one time where every single colored plastic rectangle in the south spine carpark walkway was pasted with his ads. Aren't you basically just repeating whatever I said?
In my opinion, it would be better to tell those preachers nicely, not shoo them away or even worse, reprimand them for simply wanting to spread the gospel.

The preachers may have been too clingy or forceful towards people accepting Christ, and I dissuade that. But OP should also treat others with respect and kindness.

Since both parties are at fault, they ought to repent and change accordingly. How would you interpret your last paragraph then? That's interesting! 

I think I encountered the duo OP mentioned once, don't think they were from CU.. just happened to be visiting a CU event that day haha I interpret it as, ""he and I may share the same faith, but I do not share the same belief in tolerating the harrassment of others.""

How in the world u took it to mean I am questioning his christian faith, when I myself am a christian, is beyond me."

Should I drop out? ,"Hiii I‚Äôm a y3 student supposedly planning to graduate next year but I‚Äôm currently on academic warning and have failed 2 mods this semester. 
The outlook now is that I probably won‚Äôt be able to clear finish all my modules and still increase my gpa above 2 within the AY.
I have submitted an appeal for one of the modules hopping that there‚Äôs an error somewhere but in the scenario that I really failed and I don‚Äôt want to extend my studies‚Ä¶ should I drop out? 

Some context: I really hate what I‚Äôm studying and I don‚Äôt really have any future plans thought out yet‚Ä¶. 

Wise words and some wisdom needed ü´†


Update 1: just calculated my grades needed to pull my gpa up which is B and above for all my remaining mods and just called the school if I passed every mods this AY but don‚Äôt achieve above 2 gpa was told that I will not be getting a certificate for completing my degree‚Ä¶ can anyone with similar experience advice me on who I should meet or talk to to change my situation‚Ä¶ my undergraduate office just told me that in no situation will I be able to get my certificate as long as my gpa falls below 2‚Ä¶.  Don't drop out you are already y3 dont drop out bro a pass or third class degree is btr than no degree trust me Don‚Äôt drop out bro, you really need this degree Oh no don‚Äôt drop out‚Ä¶ Maybe consider extending 1-2 to more years to spread the courses out while still being able to join new ccas and stuff, if u still have BDEs use them on mods u rly like!!! Do you need someone to talk to? I hated my course as well but I somehow managed to pull through.

Often, all we need is someone to talk to to better understand what's going wrong ‚Äî nobody gets into uni and gets academic warning for no reason. Sometimes it's unavoidable, like personal circumstances. But if it's for reasons like constant lethargy and lack of purpose, that's definitely something that you can work through :)

Feel free to DM me! For now, just take things easy and collect your strength for final year. Find out what‚Äôs the financial needs to extend 1 or 2 semester, get all the necessary $$ values from your school NOW. 

Plan accordingly with your school on what‚Äôs an acceptable load, and you come out with your rough idea also to cross check with them. 

Unload abit of AUs per sem whereas possible to catch up, especially coming 1st sem, to get motivations . At the same time, source for your desired internship and work like a ‚Äúslave‚Äù. 

Trust me, I almost drop into academic warning. But these are what I did and I managed to pull up my gpa gradually afterwards. While it‚Äôs close to another range, I guess I‚Äôve done my best. Plus currently, im awaiting for the 2 job interview results that I had attended and my internship boss looking to have me back. So it‚Äôs not really about gpa to me now. 

While GPA does matters, I think so does your relevant experience in the portfolio. It‚Äôs still not the end. You just need to hard sell yourself in another way, and work hard. Don‚Äôt drop out‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre almost there already, tahan abit more‚Ä¶ Whats the reason why your not doing well in school may i ask?
 
Not academically inclined?
 
Lack of interest?
 
External commitment?
 
Advice depends on the root of the issues. I don‚Äôt want to assume its lack of interest automatically. Siao...3rd year already just get it and done with. Target to pass and get your damn paper. I won't want the money, time and effort go to waste.

U will eventually wont be working, what you have studied also. But a degree goes a long way. I think graduating with a degree would still open more doors for you. If you dropped out I don‚Äôt think you can have subsidised degree again so it might not be affordable again. If you know what you want to do after dropping out then cut your losses early.

If you don't know what you want to do after dropping out then no. Don't drop out. 1 year is like 8 months lf actual school, just hold on a while and try your hardest. I was trying to maintain my grades back in year 4 as well, low hope but then covid happened and got free SUs(pass/fail). So yeah, unpredictable things may happen, just try, don't waste the 3 years bro don‚Äôt drop out. one of my good friends got acad warning in Y3S1. just push through it and get the degree like what others here have said, whatever you wanna do after is up to you. use the degree as a safety net. my friend is now in his last sem and on track to graduate don't drop out! you've already completed 3 years and it would be a waste to give up just before reaching the finish line! don't give up yet! your goal now is to graduate :D Firstly kudos to you for wanting to get help. Before you embark on your journey again, take a one day break and just chillax and relax as much as possible. 

You need to remove all thoughts about dropping out as it‚Äôs already into the halfway mark. Here‚Äôs what you need to do. Look at your course modules and jot down 

1)How much more AUs needed for graduation 
2)Which prerequisite modules you might have failed and need for further advancement. 

I need you to overload 1 to 3 more modules per semester to complete your degree on time. If prerequisite modules are not offered this semester then you just have to roll with other mods first.

If you really do not want to drop out, trust me you got to grind and put in the work from week 1 day 1. Just head to the Mac‚Äôd and work your way every single day.

Tough but definitely doable. Don‚Äôt drop out! Nobody will care about grades in the future anyways. Get help? From seniors.. from classmates...U be surprised people are ready to render help. If you're not rich don't drop out hello! alumni here. i almost dropped out in my final year. im glad i didn‚Äôt. i also hated what i studied. i dreaded going to school and submitting assignments / going for exams. this feeling was there since y2 and i thought about switching courses but decided to tahan

my advice is to do the bare minimum. at least show up for classes, submit what you need to (incomplete and on time is better than late/never submit in my experience), attend the exams

i had a job abt one month aft my final exam and it was unrelated to my degree and i did not include my gpa in my resume

honestly, i believe employers nowadays dont look at gpa (unless u wanna go to a very reputable company). what matters is ur passion, what relevant skillsets you have and your willingness to learn.

if you need more time, dont be afraid to take an extra sem to complete your studies or try and clear some mods during summer break (thats what i did)

can always apply for a loan or if youre taking less mods in a semester, you may hv more time to work pt to fund your following semester

i do know of someone who withdrew in their final year and is currently employed (diploma pay) and they are happy doing what theyre doing now. 

theres no right or wrong answer tbh, but you would just have to bear in mind what you would need to do and what consequences youre willing to face for either decision you make

jia you op!!! Sometimes people chose the wrong course because who would have predicted what you expected to be? 

You just need to convince yourself to pull through even with bare minimum. The pay jump for degree still matters and at least you have more opportunities unlocked such as manager roles, higher paying job switch opportunities. 

You have already been through 2+ years , just tahan abit. Are you out of your mind? Extending 1-2 years is difficult as I‚Äôm currently in a very financially tight situation‚Ä¶ the main problem however is my gpa. If it‚Äôs not increased to 2 in the next 2 sem I‚Äôll be forced to drop out :( no longer joining as CCAs etc as well to focus on my grades but still failed 2 mods this semester üò™ possible to take loan? you're almost finishing pls dont drop out. a pass is really better than nothing just focus on passing. don‚Äôt worry too much about it. 

about the grades, just move on to find a job after graduating, don‚Äôt worry about that either, confirm can find a job and gain experience. there‚Äôs a shitton of jobs out there that you can get that are not related to your degree at all.

DO NOT DROP OUT. You are so close already. Try to focus hard on just passing and graduating okay? No worries on that, NTU won‚Äôt exactly expel you so long you keep trying. How I know? Not boasting but was on the list for 3 sems from the get go and I‚Äôve never failed any mods ü•≤

Managed to grad with my batch mates in the end. All I can say is just keep trying and see how things go from there. You should be assigned an admin to check in with every now and then under the AW, can seek advice or assistance from them if this is still the case and they are friendly enough to help you Hiii did you managed to pull your gpa up above 2? If you did not did you just complete the degree or did NTU give u a cert for the completion of your degree? I managed to do so after 3 sems + 1 specia sem. If you‚Äôre borderline 2 CGPA by graduation, they will try to find ways to help you. Just focus on trying to score above Bs now. It‚Äôs doable but with effort and support from friends!!"
Singapore's Wooden Building of the Future Has a Mold Problem," When the Gaia building at Singapore‚Äôs Nanyang Technological University opened last year, it was heralded as a revolutionary step toward a greener future. The massive structure‚Äî450,000 square feet‚Äîwas constructed from sustainably harvested timber beams and panels. But these days, students and faculty are more focused on an unexpected downside: mold sprouting from all that wood. ‚ÄúIt makes me feel a little grossed out,‚Äù says fourth-year student Grace Ng.

Gaia is made from superthin layers of Austrian spruce glued together.Source: Nanyang Technological University
The problem highlights issues that can bedevil timber structures worldwide. While companies from Walmart Inc. to Microsoft Corp. have explored wood as a sustainable construction material, moldy timber in buildings has contributed to sickness, damage and legal battles from London to Melbourne.

Producing materials such as cement and steel is responsible for about 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Trees, by contrast, absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, and when their wood is used in construction, that carbon remains sequestered. The supplier of the wood for the S$125 million ($94 million) Gaia building says the structure stores more than 5,000 tons of CO2, after accounting for shipping.

But what looks good on paper has gotten a reality check in tropical Singapore, where it rains about 180 days a year. The wood in Gaia is primarily Austrian spruce, which was used to manufacture so-called mass-engineered timber‚Äîsuperthin layers glued into panels and beams that can be fashioned into columns, walls, roofs and more.

The Unexpected Downside of Eco-Friendly Wood Buildings: Mold
The trouble is spruce has a lower resistance to mold than many other species. In a place where relative humidity frequently reaches 80%, spruce that‚Äôs not properly treated is vulnerable to mold and rot, says Andrew Wong of the International Wood Culture Society. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically a climate problem,‚Äù Wong says. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre in the tropics, and that requires special attention.‚Äù

But such problems aren‚Äôt confined to the tropics. Desert climates have huge variations in temperature, which can cause excessive expansion and contraction of wood, ultimately cracking it. In subzero climates, water can get into gaps and freeze, splitting timber elements. Engineers must take all of that into account when designing timber buildings, says Erik L‚ÄôHeureux, associate professor of architecture at the National University of Singapore. ‚ÄúThere are limitations and challenges to each climate,‚Äù he says.

Singapore has used mass-engineered timber in 20-plus projects in the past decade, and more than 30 companies there have begun or completed projects with it. Singapore officials, though, haven‚Äôt said whether other buildings are suffering mold problems.

Singapore‚Äôs traditional shophouses.Source: Alamy
Singapore‚Äôs colorful shophouses‚Äîtwo- and three-story colonial-era buildings with ornate plasterwork‚Äîfeature beams made from hardwoods native to the region, which have a natural resistance to mold. But such wood is difficult to find and costs far more today than in the 1900s, when most of the shophouses were built.

Oil palm plantations have replaced many Southeast Asian forests, making chengal‚Äìthe hardwood traditionally used in Singapore‚Äìscarce. And it‚Äôs ideally harvested after about a century, while spruce can reach maturity in a third as long. Hardwood is rarely used in big projects, because ‚Äúit‚Äôs really expensive,‚Äù says Loh Kee Soon, a lead architect for Gaia at RSP Architects Planners & Engineers. To use such timber at scale, ‚Äúyou‚Äôd need a very large forest,‚Äù he says.

While the problems might have been mitigated by thicker protective coating, Loh‚Äôs team rejected that out of cost considerations and because they wanted to highlight the grain of the natural wood. Larch, a softwood with greater resistance to mold, would have been pricier, so Loh used spruce, cladding the columns most exposed to sun and rain with larch.

There‚Äôs little argument about the aesthetic value of Gaia, which houses the university‚Äôs business school. The building‚Äôs 700-foot-long facade curves gently, its interior resembling a giant ski lodge bathed in natural light, with lush gardens tucked into internal courtyards. The ground floor is breezy and open, with no doors at the entrances.

More than a dozen conversations with students and staff who use the building, though, yield disgust, humor and concern about the problem. One staffer says he avoids his office because he‚Äôs afraid the mold will aggravate respiratory issues. ‚ÄúIf the mold is just ugly, it‚Äôs not an issue,‚Äù says student Lifei Shan. ‚ÄúBut since it can cause health problems, the school has to clean it up.‚Äù

Mold expert Joey Feng checks for the presence of mold.Photographer: Ore Huiying/Bloomberg
The first thing visitors see and smell is the fragrant Austrian spruce that makes up the bulk of the building. Joey Feng, a mold inspector from a company called Air & Odor Management, isn‚Äôt impressed. Spotting white flecks that look like dust on a wooden pillar, Feng takes a sample with a swab and dips it into a clear liquid that turns lavender, indicating mold. She later finds more growth on air vents, which risks spreading it through the building. ‚ÄúI would treat this room immediately,‚Äù she says.

The school and architect Loh note that mold isn‚Äôt rare in humid Singapore, and they say it‚Äôs unlikely to affect structural integrity. Nonetheless, the school has developed ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù maintenance plans for Gaia, including reapplying sealant on the timber, adjusting the air-conditioning and asking staff to keep windows closed to reduce condensation. Experts in the field suggest treating surfaces with bleach, applying heavier coatings on the wood, installing dehumidifiers and running the AC 24/7, though that would make the building less sustainable.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think of anywhere on Earth you could not use mass timber, if it‚Äôs designed for that particular climate,‚Äù says Art Schmon, an analyst at timber consultant Forest Economic Advisors. ‚ÄúThe disadvantage is that it increases cost. Is it still competitive with steel and concrete? That‚Äôs a separate question.‚Äù Not just wood. Anyone noticed that a lot of painted concrete buildings are turning black faster nowadays ? I blame climate change. The weather is just hotter and wetter, so the mold is growing faster :-(

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/singapore/hdb-sengkang-flats-mould-paint-jamus-lim-3197901 Why build time-proof buildings when you can greenwash by pretending buildings to be ecological? Which idiot approved this? I had to get a dehumidifier because mold was growing on our bags in Singapore. Yup, had my first mod the last monday (Biz year 2 and only BDE then can use Gaia???). In the lecture all I was focussed on 30 percent of the time is the mold pattern on the ceiling beams. can anyone just paste the article here So, now how??????? How much money are wasted????

video showcasing the mould‚Ä¶ Just an anecdotal sidetrack here, I never buy ecological or biodegradable yoga mats, phone cases, plastic bags anymore after they degraded on me. The whole point of like phone case and yoga mat is to buy it once and use for life and not have it engineered to disintegrate after a couple of years. Seems like a good way to generate sales if anything. Planned obsolescence. do you have snapshots of the mould?

Slight rant about the whole SDL thing in uni,"So I'm a freshie that just started school and idk if im being na√Øve or something but I'm starting to get disillusioned with how the uni system works in general. My main gripe is the fact that they purport and tell us that a lot of uni learning is self directed and you gotta pull up your own socks to make the most of the education here but what I had thought of that notion prior to enrolling is that we might have to do some readings, and come to class. What I did NOT expect was for professors for some mods (not all I emphasise) to just drop a youtube playlist link thats like a few years old and for the mod to have basically 0 lectures throughout and expect us to watch the whole thing, complete the tutorial then attend it which happens like once a week like legit dafuq? So you mean to tell me that I'm paying school fees for a goddamn youtube link which means that if I have a senior friend whos taking my course and the same mods he can just drop me the links and I'm basically as educated as he is? Like whats stopping pre tertiary and secondary schools from doing the same thing, recording a lecture once then just throwing the link to all future students till the curriculum changes like I'm sorry didn't I come to what is supossedly one of the best schools in the world to oh I don't know get an education? Anyways if I'm being dumb about anything I said I'm open to comments, but yeah the whole SDL thing is kinda weird to me like what kinda education is this lol might as well get a degree from watching Khan Academy. What course are you from? I'm a year 3 cs student and that doesn't sound normal at all. I have never had any YouTube videos as my lectures before

If this was my course, I'm definitely gonna grade them poorly in the course evaluation That does NOT sound normal, I would be a total karen about it and email the school admin with the screenshots. (One prof tried to threaten to dock grades for bad course reviews and got into trouble for it. Absolutely do not worry about retaliation) What‚Äôs your major? But welcome to Uni haha. I‚Äôm from NBS and it‚Äôs not uncommon for things to be this way. Still, I think the live tutorials/seminar classes are the most meaningful because that‚Äôs where you get to ask questions, engage with others and learn. The recorded lectures mainly serve as introductory groundwork/foundation so you‚Äôd have more substantial content to discuss in the live seminars. I've not had a single class like this. What's your major? Sometimes you listen to the prof‚Äôs lecture you also don‚Äôt understand. And sometimes YouTube might be your saviour. Shoutout to Abdul Bari Putting it like this, I realised one of my previous mods was like this too. Never thought of it like that, but I get where you're coming from.

One way to go about it is to think of uni as an agent service providing the links to the necessary places and basically planning out your study route. Sure, you could get the link if you had a senior in there, but without a proper learning plan or the materials to apply them in practice, the knowledge will just be dormant and not that useful (said using the mod that I had in mind).

But I totally understand OP, ultimately school fees are, like what everyone says, just paying for the degree. Don‚Äôt know what OP course is from, but I had one mod last year which was like this, it was MH1811 Well end of the day u‚Äôre paying for the degree and the name of the school. The actual education is just a bonus thats executed poorly most of the time Bet this is an ICC mod. Still sucks to hear this though :/ This is happening to some of the mods in the PSP that I'm under, maybe its just my programme but yeah its p annoying Y4 cs here. there is. The videos were created, uploaded by the professor himself.. it's giving anders math Which module was this for? 

  
Thinking back, only Dr. loke had youtube based videos, but he used it as a live streaming platform for his live lectures, and his recorded lectures were on his channel as well

  
But for Dr. Loke at least, his videos are new for every semester as it is a live recording where you can ask questions in the chat, unlike OP's but anders is actually pretty good tho as much as i hated Dr Loke‚Äôs lectures and exams, u gotta give the man credit for trying (the many memes of him being a testament to that)"
So many people want to swap out of Hall 14 üíÄ," Freshman here
Why do so many not want 14?
Oso these hall allocations that have came out are for seniors right? RIP really need a megathread if not so much spam. Later the freshies also want hall swap then no need ask other questions already. I got no halls. Would be grateful even if it's hall 14.
Is there any way?! One thing I love about hall 14 is how secluded the canteen is from everywhere else on campus. If I have time, I actually go all the way there just for lunch to avoid crowds. I think it‚Äôs because of this: https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/sVB7VGjwd2 14 still busy though 14 lunchtime is v crowded also Damn üò∞ Idt that's a valid thing, every hall has its own problems.

They still gotta improve tho Yeah prob big W for OP since your prev post in this sub in mainly about BDE selection. But they should have notify this before add drop ended then at least people can play around with their BDE selection I saw the title and I thought I was in the FGO subreddit.

But finally they change the system, just got to do it 1 year after I graduate right?

Happy for you guys though Wow thats like almost 15  years after i first encountered it when it came out and i was wondering when or if they would switch to this lol.

Can i just say, finally?

Lol The retroactive viewing of past S/U grades is the cherry on top. So happy for juniors! Took them long enough, didn't it? This is the speed of change in this university and it wants to be in the global top 10? Oh well, at least it finally happened. If we have s/u previous mods before can we see our actual grades for those mods so we can choose if we want to keep them at S/U or not? Wooo‚Ä¶.ü•≥ so good. This one can do to core mods or only bde? heard some students push hard for this even pitch to their acad schol office So I can SU from this sem onwards is it? Fate Grand Order has happened in NTU Still a place run by boomers who dont understand the ground can u s/u core mods Gawd. It is supposed to decrease the grade grubbing culture at NTU but it will only make it worse by the students becoming even more strategic and exam obsessive. Just focus on the learning for crissakes!  NTU admin continue to be a bunch of backward looking reactionaries. Weak strawberries. Last time unker just grind and worry later. If anything it shows that they are capable of changing, but seemingly lack the incentive to do so. Big win for eeeeeeveryone, but yes, i agree. I think they shouldve informed post registration period ngl. Oh well, at the very least we have a bit more control of our grades now? Semi big wins hah. LMAO i feel you about the FGO subreddit

I had to double take Canteen upgrade after I graduated too lol Legit. üò≠ They could have done it at the time where I got a damn C for one of my BDEs. Thank you, NTU. Jk, at least the future cohorts get it haha Thought it was finally going to be like NUS' system, but got disappointed again In a nutshell, yes. But only end of this sem for anyone who basically studied before AY24-25 batch. So SUs so far can be toggled this sem. But upcoming ones, can wait. Read the email, or probably scroll down to see infographics. It answers your qn This is the win for the worry post grind, unker. Yeah true , I mean that‚Äôs just NTU. Ig if we make enough noise, they‚Äôll change it in the next 4-5 years Their incentive apparently seems to be public perception. Whatever may hurt the popularity will push them to change Hey I asked the question and you give an answer like what OP did. They're pretty resistant to change for a university that claims to be forward looking and embracing the future. It's a pretty high threshold to cross before change is implemented because the people at the top are stuck in their old outdated ways It needs time to hurt enough though. And it takes a lot of time for it to hurt their image enough. NTU excuse for not allowing earlier S/U options was that it would affect ""academic rigour"". While NUS that actually ranks higher than them is practicing the very S/U Option that NTU refused to implement with the exception of that one semester during the pandemic when enough noise was made (only towards the end of the  semester, when everyone already worked pretty hard on their grades, except those that gave up) Then after that semester it went back to normal and it took them a further 3 years to finally see what people were trying to tell them for the last 10 years. Ok the answer is yes Good boy"

"The irony of ""socialising""","My entire uni life, I thought of making friends and  tried to be social during orientations, during CCAs and etc but ended up not having close connections.

So during internship I decided to focus more on my internship and not on socialising.

And then I ended up having the opposite effect on Week 5 whereby I ended up socialising during internship with a few interns.....

Moral of the story: I talk too much and need to stfu. Haha a funny thing of life is that sometimes the more we pursue something, the further it recedes from us. And the less we pursue it, with the mindset of letting the chips fall where they may, surprisingly it comes knocking on our doorstep. Glad to hear that you're socializing like you initially hoped for. bad takeaway. you interact way more with ppl at work which is a few months than orientations or CCAsn which are like few days.

so naturally you will socialise more.
nothing wrong with talking a lot Bro failed to be mysterious and nonchalant Jiayous OP!"
They really couldn't care less,"It's my first week of being a freshman here but my opinion of this place has already been thoroughly soiled. 

Tried to take an exemption test for SC1003, followed all the instructions, and pretested the website (HackerEarth) the day before (Friday) to make sure I was able to do the test, according to the instructions. The test was an hour long and the window to begin it was also exactly an hour; there was no margin for error. If I found issues, I could've gone home to do it on another laptop since it was on a Saturday (today), but nothing was awry.

FF to the test window, I launch the test, and the website hits me with an error that wasn't accounted for in the pretesting instructions, which prevents me from proceeding. I follow the on-screen troubleshooting from the website but it doesn't work out. So, I immediately e-mail my prof going back and forth trying to troubleshoot the problem, and eventually the window lapses. He then offers to let me do the test in person, so I rush over to the venue.

I get to hardware lab 2 and explain who I am to whom I assume is a lab tech, and he seats me at a desktop to do the test. I start the clock and almost immediately, I have another issue, and so I call on the lab tech. He tries to diagnose the problem (2-3 mins) but gets stuck and calls the prof. It takes him another 5-7 mins to arrive and realize that I was trying to edit the pre-written read-only code within the editor (I had never used HackerEarth before, so I didn't realize), which derails my train of thought. This is especially detrimental to me as I already have trouble with my train of thought, which causes me to have spasms if I don't accommodate for it properly. At this point I'm already very unfocused and annoyed especially at the tone of the professor and the fact that I can't edit that code, but I continue with the test.

The first question goes smoothly (took about 10 mins), but I spend an excessive amount of time on the second question trying to figure out why my program fails on one of the test cases, and so the test ends (ig this means I failed).

While preparing to leave, the lab tech from earlier snarks ""better check your laptop next time"".

(Paraphrasing here)

\[Me\]: Yeah. (My mind's still working on the code lol)

\[Lab tech\]: Looks like you don't know how to use your own laptop.

(I think the prof told him about everything)

\[Me\]: I followed the pretesting instructions yesterday, I didn't find anything wrong.

\[Lab tech\]: Then how come your camera like that? (The problem was with my mac's webcam)

\[Me\]: The instructions said nothing about my camera and I was able to start and finish the practice test. Why wasn't it in the instructions?

\[Lab tech\]: There were 60 students, you are the only one with problem.

\[Me\]: Which means you'll just ignore the issue?

.

.

\[Lab tech\]: You had problem, so the prof and I let you sit this test here.

\[Me\]: So you just want a ""thank you""? You do realize if the instructions were better, I wouldn't be having this problem at all, right?

\[Lab tech\]: I could have just ignored it and let you do SC1003.

\[Me\]: Wow. You really sunk my opinion of NTU just by that line alone, and I've only been here a week. What is your name?

\[Lab tech\]: If you have so much problem here, why don't you study somewhere else?

\[Me\]: Did you really just say ""just don't study at NTU""?

\[Lab tech\]: (Says something but avoids the question)

\[Me\]: No, just tell me, true or false. Did you just say that?

\[Lab tech\]: (Keeps avoiding the question)



I want to escalate this issue, but I don't know how and I don't know who the lab tech is.

I've already been experiencing other issues at NTU like online lectures having 500+ participants, leaving no room for interaction. If the only thing I'm allowed to do is ask one-line questions through Q&A's, why wouldn't I just watch the pre-recorded lectures that we're required to watch and just pose my doubts to chatGPT? I'm really struggling to understand why NTU is so highly ranked.

  
tl:dr: Told to take online test, technical failures galore, and snarky faculty for the cherry on top. Won‚Äôt comment on the lab part but the part regarding online lectures seems abit redundant? If u wanted to ask the prof for anything u could email him personally tho, online lectures don‚Äôt seem to be the best place to clarify doubts since time is limited I feel it‚Äôs not right to blame the prof as he gave you a chance to retake the test physically. I guess exemption is a privilege. As for the lab tech we dk his side of the story. You could be upset due to the results and came of as aggressive. Let‚Äôs just hope we can learn smth new in this mod. Cheer up. ""So you just want a ""thank you""? You do realize if the instructions were better, I wouldn't be having this problem at all, right?""

Eh bro no need so aggro leh T in NTU is silent He sucks but you‚Äôre really pretty aggro. In some ways I‚Äôm admiring of that and your surety of self, so don‚Äôt get me wrong. 

Anyway I mean, sometimes I think people are very idealistic or something. You struggle to see why ntu is so highly ranked but what makes you think things are really so good elsewhere and not just in Singapore?

Yes you‚Äôll soon find in life people couldn‚Äôt care less, in general. Does the lab tech happen to be fat? Ah. NTU. Of course.

https://preview.redd.it/wyhirr7a08jd1.jpeg?width=1427&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=033e2b065faed0677c6b66287accd2e0a7ba8353 look on a bright side, that's free A for sc1003 1) Very sorry to hear what you have experienced. 

2) Email the professor, undergraduate office, and Associate Chair (Academics). Tell them what happened. Forgive me if I‚Äôm not understanding this correctly but did you make it known that you needed special accommodations for tests? If not, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right for you to behave in such an entitled manner towards the prof who has already given you a concession and allowed you to take the test in person. Perhaps the lab tech‚Äôs tone was snarky (but honestly, so would anyone if they had to work on a Saturday) and I get that technical difficulties can be very very frustrating especially when it‚Äôs for a test. However, that ‚Äòthank you‚Äô remark from you really just unnecessarily made the whole conversation really aggressive. You don‚Äôt think if you said that to someone, they‚Äôd equally respond just as rudely? 60 people were taking the test and you are the only person with a problem‚Ä¶ yes, YOU are the problem! Oo damn sry to hear that man All the excuses aside, if you bombed the exemption test then you prolly need to take SC1003 Skill issues He is an employee of NTU. You are the paying customer. Don't argue with him. Lodge a complain with your prof l, the Dean and anyone you can think of. Sorry about your experience with the lab tech, I guess I was lucky to never have had such an encounter. As for the test, if they didn't specify the passing requirements, there's actually still a decent chance you passed. Plus, even if you failed, SC1003 is pretty much a guaranteed A/A+ with meagre effort for people with programming experience. OP I'm guessing you are going to be very unhappy about a lot of things for the next 20 years. You didn't have to make this so aggravating for yourself, regardless of what the lab tech said. 

Right now, the lab tech is probably enjoying his weekend. He doesn't know or care that you are burning your precious youth being angry about something he said. The price you are paying is at your own expense. I think your Prof is pretty cool for giving you another chance. I think that lab tech just needs to accept that being called back to work on weekends justfies ""Full-Time"" in the job description. Escalate please. It will help everyone. This same stuff has been going on for years and years. It should be common sense that if they write better instructions there will be fewer problems but if things go smoothly they lose their power. Well sadly to be truth but actually NTU is like Singapore MIT standards where wizard in the industry field are there to hon their skills and attending lecture is to see if you could figure out the missing areas not covered in the lecture, rather than to focus on the PowerPoint slides which is crazily draggy. That's why most wizards student just take note of key pointers and focus more on their coding side line to lecture days. That's the difference between smart Alex and those whom follow textbook answers. Maybe SMU and NUS is a better fit for you. Since you need more guidance. Hmmm I'm from EEE and there's a lab tech who was unreasonable too (I had experienced a technical issue before as well). But I couldn't be bothered to argue with her. Most professors and staff here are super nice but there are a few black sheep. dont take this the wrong way, but‚Ä¶ why would the TA, who has more important stuff to work on (like his phd), care about an undergrad causing them issues? especially an undergrad thats only in their first year and first week some more. 

it feels like ur forgetting these people have their own responsibilities which carry more weight to themselves and the university than yours do. that would be quite self-centred of u, wouldnt it? how important are u and ur y1s1 tasks that these people have to take time off their research (which actually benefits the university and its ranking) to help u? dont u know how busy they are?

also as a university STEM student pls learn to solve ur problems on ur own instead of asking TAs/ and profs to solve it for u. pls dont expect anyone to spoonfeed u here. Email mothership or any other news outlet and blow this up, they wont do anything unless it makes the news

That said, maybe u were a little bit rude towards the guy is the sc1003 exemption giving to both poly and jc students? Man, good luck in the working world. destroy that MOUTHERFUCKERRREE What do people usually use the online lectures for in that case? They advertised it as an opportunity to discuss doubts from the pre-recorded lectures I agree. It feels like OP had special treatment. Labs usually don't open on the weekend. (I requested to use the lab on the weekend for MDP but was denied permission.) Special arrangements must have been made for this to happen. I speculate that the lab tech was annoyed that he had to open the lab on a weekend. It was a perfect storm. Then again sorry you had to experience this. SC1003 is easy OP will def ace it :) yea, the lab tech is probably (understandably) pissed that the lab needed to be open for a single student on a weekend I don‚Äôt see why it‚Äôs considered generosity that the prof offered me the chance to take it physically when it could have been avoided with better instructions from their part. The exemption criteria are listed on the NTU website and I scored the required grade to fulfil it and followed all the instructions. If this is a privilege then anything NTU promises on their website can be withdrawn on a whim by some individual who just doesn‚Äôt feel like dealing with their responsibilities. My results from the test didn‚Äôt have bearing on what I said as much as the scenario I just encountered. After a fault on their end, I considered them making this arrangement for me as a way to make up for it, and expected them just leave it like that at the very least, much less try to antagonise me with those remarks about my laptop and treat me like a nuisance. What was the idea behind that? In my mind it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs been getting away with it a lot. OP is spot on. It should be obvious to anyone with a brain that they could have anticipated issues and head them off by just communicating clearly. The real question is why didn‚Äôt they do that?  What did they have to gain by keeping things vague or confusing? I'm not usually confrontational. It was just the perfect storm of me being annoyed, disappointed in my test, and me being in my own head preparing to mull about what I did wrong in the code the rest of the day when he spoke to me in that tone. I disagree. His aggressive behavior is nothing to be admired. Whip out the same replies in a workplace setting or even to service workers outside and he's just a terrible person, no matter if he was right in the first place. If the other party is being unreasonable, OP should tone it down instead of having main character syndrome and further escalating the situation. Oh F off. OP has every right to stand up for themselves. Just because there exists rude or condescending people in life doesn‚Äôt mean you have to condone that behavior - especially in a ‚Äúhighly ranked‚Äù uni like NTU? I think I know who u mean... once took a 1au lab mod that was entirely self guided (go lab watch their premade video and do the work for the session). And I didnt know anyone in class so i was on my own. 

Was doing my work when the lab tech said something really sarcastic along the lines of ""u can be the teacher already ah"", i was very confused why he targeted me so i just said ""huh?"". He gave me an annoyed look and walked away.

Half way through class, the supervising prof told the class that they were supposed to start with XX part as mentioned in the guide. Turns out everyone else in the class skipped XX part, which I was working on.

Realised the lab tech thought i was the one skipping ahead since i was doing something different from everyone else... long story HAHA but a memorably annoying one. Slightly I was really hoping to get exempted though :(( Then BCC too their boss hahaha Thank you. What do you reckon their reaction could be like? Will they sweep it under the rug or just label me ""problem student"" and penalize me somehow? I don‚Äôt think you understood it correctly, but maybe some of my new replies would help Agree to some extent That‚Äôs a terrible deduction you made so I‚Äôm not sure if it was on purpose or not but I‚Äôll explain why. In a group of 60, only one has issues with their webcam. In a group of 120, it‚Äôs more likely more than one. But since there was no test to see if webcams needed to work or instructions saying that the webcam had to be used, both have issues on test day the same way I did. The only difference between being the only one to have a problem and not being the only one is just that; the number of people who encounter it. It doesn‚Äôt say anything about who‚Äôs to blame, only about how common the issue is. Thank you Yeah ig, but it‚Äôs fine Update: I got exempted! :)) Sorry to disappoint but jokes on you if you think that actually does something You're defo right I wasn't thinking straight at that moment You were right, they granted me exemption I had lots of fun this weekend, but thanks I think it would be not cool if he didn‚Äôt give me that chance, read my reply to antique-garden I intend on escalating. I don‚Äôt want to put up with 4 years of faculty whose pass-time is to pick on freshies, but I also love the ones that brighten up this place Read my above reply for my sentiment on the generosity. In addition, the lab was already open before I got there, there was another lecture or something going on in the same lab on the other side of a partition which is where I found him, and where he went back to once he seated me, and where I called him back from when I encountered that problem. He barely had to do anything extra for me. Lab wasn‚Äôt opened just for me, read above This is mainly what I‚Äôm getting at. But the unpreparedness to handle issues, the lack of responsibility, and the lack of professionalism when giving an exam too I'll be honest. You didn't actually suffer any loss from the initial issues because you had a redo in the lab. Trying to edit read only code isn't a technical issue, at best it's a UI issue or they could've given more instructions, idk. Then the rest of the event is just two people escalating an argument for no good reason until it gets really unpleasant. This is more like two people walking into each other and neither apologizes, instead of some issue that is a huge stain on NTU as a university. I support you OP, you know how to fight for your right and voice out! I think you will do well in your future career and I mean it. 

You did not just do it for yourself but many other students, many of the admin staff are being too cocky and always like to play up high like they were the one who gave you the opportunity to study in NTU. Trust me, these jerks in the school operation will soon ruin the good reputation you are completely missing the point, its that for OP's own sake they should manage their expectations, else they will have a lot of disappointment and anger with real society and life Hmm, probably not who I have in mind then, got another lab tech can be quite cb also Free A > exemption

I regret exempting my MH1810. Don‚Äôt be intimated by the thoughts of potential retaliation. They can‚Äôt penalize you, they have to grade you based on rubrics. Don‚Äôt let a rude school staff ruin your undergrad experience. Yes My point is simple. Problems occur frequently. You have 2 options. 1) find an effective way to solve it. 2) complain or become confrontational or blame everything around you. University life is to prepare you for work life in the real world. You won‚Äôt find much handholding as you would want to have.  If you bring such attitude to work, it‚Äôs not gonna work. And if you don‚Äôt know why NTU is so highly ranked, then you shouldn‚Äôt even be there.

#googledoesexist Likely he is a TA who's working on his PhD too. Your feedback definitely will cause a lot to him Yeah, do the above. I had a terrible time during one of the intro mods for SC, iirc it is the same mod as u. Genuinely interested in considering a minor in it but the experience just made me avoid SC altogether. just complain to his huger upz. ur TA needs to be held accountable This post isn‚Äôt a whine about how much I lost or did not lose. This is an exam administered by ntu to determine whether I‚Äôm required to take the mod for the rest of the semester, but is allowed to be delivered in such an unprofessional way by  irresponsible people who are unwilling to deal with actually setting it up. The exam was only announced two days prior, with one e-mail on the day before offering limited instructions and no briefings on the actual test. This gave us all limited time to prepare, but coming from a Java background, I had to learn Python (never coded in python before) in two days because of the short notice. They made no efforts to anticipate any issues, for ample testing, or offer support if they arose, and no margin for error (1 hr test window for a 1hr test). They only announced the test after someone on the online lecture inquired about it, which feels like they just remembered about it, and tasked a random prof with setting up this test as saikang, which he does in half an hour and forgets about it. Thanks a lot, really. Your words of encouragement makes me want to encourage other people. Agree to disagree Okay, I‚Äôll write to them and post an update later What makes you think I didn‚Äôt try everything I could to rectify the issue ASAP? The clock starts ticking as soon as the window opens so I simultaneously e-mailed my prof and tried every single solution online. Do you really think I was just sitting there watching my exam time tick by?   I couldn‚Äôt have done anything more in my power; the exam is set up by them. Any less ‚Äúhand-holding‚Äù as you call it and I‚Äôd have to host my own exam. For a fault on their part, causing me so much panic, don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs heavily unfair to be treated with added disrespect? I‚Äôm sorry you had to deal with this dichotomy but it doesn‚Äôt have to be this way. Pigeon, if you try to be introspective and blame yourself for every unfortunate thing that happens to you, your life is gonna get so hard and I‚Äôd recommend psychotherapy. It‚Äôs important to stand up and advocate for yourself. You might change your mind 2 years in You need to take the red pill. Only those that walk through the process can appreciate this statement. You‚Äôre very obnoxious Currently year 3 with standing year 4, that extra 5.0 on MH1810 can push me into 1st upper :( What kind of ‚Äòobnoxious‚Äô? The ‚Äòanything that don‚Äôt go my way kind‚Äô or the standard dictionary kind or ‚Äòpigeon pooping‚Äô kind coo coo?"
Thoughts after Y2S2,"Hi friend , I am glad you have finished Y2S2 , going for exchange soon man. I know this past sem has not be easy for you but I am glad you pulled it through. 

Study tips: Take down whatever notes your prof write , don‚Äôt be lazy and procrastinate ( ask your questions to prof/TA directly or through emails ) Most of them are really helpful and profs are willing to arrange for physical consultations.

Also , never do last minute study. We can start studying for a test / finals early and doing a few chapters per day so that we give our mind to consolidate all the new information. Afterwards, challenge yourself to write out the information that we have recalled without referring back to our notes . Practise this again and again, you will definitely be more confident in yourself. Don‚Äôt think that your questions are stupid because clarification is better than ignorant . 

Sometimes , people may say people who are actively participating in tutorials are class sluts but when you are more engaged , you tend to be more interested in the topic

I also face some heartbreaks in school , it affected me a lot until the point I felt depressed and no mood to study. It‚Äôs tough very very tough , sometimes we may look at the past and ask ourselves why this happen. I ran almost everyday at SRC wave in school and this keeps me motivated. I became more introverted last sem but I was glad I have the support from my good friends. It is important to share our thoughts or inner feelings with people if not it gets worse till people may commit suicide or have no will to live. 

Wah, how come all my sem in NTU seem to be a new challenge. My GPA is decent 
4.26 to 4.43 to 4.48 and to 4.44

So is my goal FCH? Maybe ? But now I am not striving for FCH as much as before in Y1 or Y2S1. Sometimes I will prefer good health over grades. Good health be it mental or physical health, I hope those who are reading these take some time to relax and chill before next sem starts again , always find meaning first before mugging so hard for grades. Grades aren‚Äôt everything, the will we have to stand back up from setbacks are what it takes that will push us further in life. Thanks for reading HAHAHA"
Thoughts of dropping out/withdrawing,"

International freshie here
Sorry for the rant but I do need some advice!

I‚Äôm financially poor (from a single family with lower than $800/mth income) so applied to a bunch of bursaries & study loans. 
Did manage to get a few.( that‚Äôs the main reason why I accepted the offer & matriculated)
For context, it‚Äôs ocbc tuition fee loan & another half-loan half-grant scheme in my home country.

Enrolled into econs without studying econs before. 
My mother was stressing out & struggling because of me . We both cried a lot recently lol.
Especially we‚Äôre currently facing difficulties finding a surety for my tuition grant. If no one can help it‚Äôs gonna be 40k$ per year and we totally won‚Äôt be able to afford it, and I‚Äôll definitely drop out after that,which means I‚Äôll have to pay 20k$ for sem 1 still.

Now stressing about studies& financial difficulties &mental health 

Should I just drop out in teaching week 2 since they wont charge me a full semester of tuition fees? Although I understand some fees may be charged still. It‚Äôs better than slowly crushing my mentality.

Thanks in advance!


update: 
one of my mom‚Äôs friends said they can be a surety, but will need my mom to withdraw her bank savings and open a joint account together with him(total sgd 50000 )

 I don‚Äôt think I should be selfish cuz it‚Äôs almost all of my mom‚Äôs savings. It‚Äôs a big amount.

So currently I‚Äôll be looking for other unis, although it‚Äôs so frustrating that all my efforts became wasted, at least I can study peacefully without big concerns!

Update 2:
I‚Äôve submitted my withdrawal and contacted my mentor, still not out yet tho!  I think given how high the risks are for you not securing something, it might be best to cut your losses now. Feels like you have to play the min-max game here, all in or all out.

If you insist on doing an education outside of Malaysia but have little to no funds, there are options. 

German public universities - choices for english bachelors are few but free even for internationals. Avoid the private ones and be aware that some public ones will charge you. Also try to avoid the big cities, rental is killer out there.

Needs blind universities in America. Unfortunately the universities that offer such aid is limited to the most competitive types like Princeton. But, should you get in, you would get a full ride education.

The last option, which admittedly would be somewhat insane if feasible, would be to do an online masters at CU Boulder. You will be limited to the few options they offer, but, it only costs USD15k for the entire programme and you don't need a bachelors to enter. It is risky though as you won't be admitted unless you pass the first 2 courses which you must pay for.

Good luck figuring this out. My dms are open, I'd like to help if you want it. I know it was almost the last step to get me all set to study in Singapore but I‚Äôm just tired &frustrated after all these months dealing with the agreements , and I don‚Äôt think I can bear the stress for another 4 years. Malaysian here too, I'll DM you my telegram handle, feel free to rant to me if you need someone to listen. I'm not exactly a good financial advisor so I'll try not to give any suggestions. However if U want my opinion on matters i will share no problem. where are you from? what are your backup plans if you do drop out? are there any unis that you have applied to in ur home country? Hey OP,

I don't really have any advice but just thought I'd share my  finances as it's similar situation to yours hopefully it can help you to make a decision.

I also took tuition grant and tuition fee loans as well, but also took the study loan + living allowance loan. My month expenses is around 650SGD(live frugally)and can be funded through the work study scheme if you manage to find a job for 16 hours per week(maximum allowed). Over the summer I did an internship, which converted to part time during the sem which definitely help my expenses( tbh I was lucky to get this internship). The biggest help was definitely the MOE, tuition grant which basically halves the intl tuition fees.

In the end, my parents had to pay around 7k SGD yearly which roughly the equivalent of a private edu in Malaysia( albeit probably on the higher end). But in exchange you are pretty much guarantee a work pass( landing a job is ofc, not guaranteed ) considering you have to serve your bond and more doors opened for your career compared to Malaysia( imo ). 

Wish you all the best op. Im not able to give any good advices but i hope things get better for you ü´∂üèª I think that opening joint account with the $5K sounds dangerous for your mum. Could be a scam. Do get her to be careful. Buddy in this situation it is not worth it. There are many jobs you can do without a degree for a start. You can save some money and in a few years you can get a degree knowing better what you want and need. It's a shitty situation you are in, and I am not sure 40k in dept per year is going to help anybody. Thanks for the sharing & advices! I feel a lot better now, I think I kinda made up my mind, will have a talk with my mom and look deep into the procedures tomorrow. Gotta go to bed now, wishing everyone a good night sleep üí§ Speak to the school to see what they can do on their end also! 

Tbh, while things may not look smooth now, just know that I‚Äôm glad that you come to a point to rant things out here rather than keeping it to yourself. Jiayous ‚ò∫Ô∏è Hi OP, don't have any advice for you but I hope it all works out for you, jiayou! Can consider working part time while studying. (Of course it's going to be very exhausting but it will help your school fees a little)


Otherwise, I'd say just take a loan and continue with your studies. After graduating, you can slowly repay the loan. Will take a while for sure, but imagine the opportunities you can get being a NTU graduate (compared to other less prestigious universities) S$40k per year could basically pay for a house and living expenses in RM, it's a lot of money for anyone.

I honestly don't see how you can fund your entire education here purely from bursaries and household income - I did part time work while undergrad, and full time work while doing post grad. It is super expensive even for a local who is receiving subsidies.

Even after getting a NTU degree you'll still have a steep uphill fight as a fresh grad facing essentially unlimited competition for jobs in SG. You have to calculate ahead with that 4-5 year plan in mind.

Crying and prayers will not improve your situation, you have to find some form of work while studying. Hi there, though I don‚Äôt know you personally. Money matters can really take a toll on a person, you got a good spot just that you need a surety. Imagine yourself looking back, this is just a short storm in your life journey and if you dropped this chance how that would affect you, e.g. lost opportunities. Try your uncles, aunts, relatives etc Wah. Don‚Äôt get stuck in the poverty cycle. If I‚Äôm in this situation I would probably be desperate enough to do OF to repay tuition fees, no joke. Given that you come from financially poor family. its the best in your interest for you to drop out first and reapply into a program that give you a full scholarship/sponsorship to study abroad. You are not going reach the moon just by studying in a famous university, its just the first step. Bless OP and their family. Please visit the NTU wellbeing office located near Lee Wee Nam Library at North Spine. I am sure they will be able to support and find a solution for you along the way! They will be able to pressure the other departments of the school and arrange special agreements on a case by case basis. Help JDHSBKZISJ it‚Äôs already after week 2 I‚Äôm still insecure and stressed about this, I honestly can‚Äôt see myself anywhere in the future,might bcz my brain is acting up. Last week I applied to change course to something I‚Äôm more familiar with and might be able to cope with but still no outcome, oh well I guess no hope üò≠and the bursaries too no email received,if none of them are received I‚Äôll just go ahead and withdraw still( they‚Äôre my last hopes) hi op, just wondering did you not manage to get the moe tuition grant? im pretty surprised since it is relatively easy to get as long as you applied for it Degree from the top 3 local uni e.g NTU and NUS will set u apart. You can do part time job to help offset your tuition fee as well. Take out a loan. In the long run it is worth it. 

I am position now that i see how the hiring process goes, and if u have degree from the local top 3, it put u in much better position compare to the uni. Of course later on in the career, it matters less and less. But for starting few jobs, it does matter alot. Thank you for the options given! Yeah studying in uni became a high risk situation üòÇ I‚Äôll look into the options u given later, they do piqued my interest!! Thanks a lot I‚Äôm sorry ahhh I know I deserve the downvotes so I‚Äôll delete this post once I sort out these scattered thoughts ü•π Hi OP, have u applied for the kuok foundation? Heard tht they give extremely generous scholarship / loans to malaysians. if you‚Äôre from a bigger independent school if im not wrong some independent schools has alumni scholarships / loans as well. Thank you! this comment made me felt better already, thanks for being with me. Will dm if needed !! Malaysia! Haven‚Äôt think of that actually. I did apply for a few and rejected them for NTU(all private unis cuz my qualifications can‚Äôt enrol in Malaysia‚Äôs government unis) So I think I can reapply if needed <: Thank you for the long reply that actually helps a lot! Yeah private unis in Malaysia be quite expensive and not that worthy. Will it be hard to balance ur studies tho? That‚Äôs the thing I‚Äôm most concerned about Thanks! That means a lot alrd ~ Yeah it‚Äôs actually S$50k, it‚Äôs a lot and I shouldn‚Äôt put her in a dangerous position, even tho he‚Äôs a reliable friend, but yep too many unforseen circumstances You‚Äôre right, a degree worths a lot but if it‚Äôs gonna affect my whole family to a burden point, It‚Äôs not worth it. If I‚Äôm unable to receive tuition grant I think I‚Äôll just reapply to another cost effective uni while I still have interest in studying! Just a reminder to be extra cautious if your mum decides to open a joint account with her friend who has agreed to be your surety. Make sure the account is a ""joint-all""account, NOT a ""joint-alternative"" account. Otherwise I'm not sure if your mum's hard earned savings will be secured in that account, since either one of the 2 account holders will be able to withdraw money from that account without having to inform the other account holder. Hope everything works out for you! All the best and take care! Hi what did u decide? Best of luck Thank you! Yeah I‚Äôve been keeping things within my own and unfortunately I‚Äôm not that strong:< I‚Äôm happy that everyone is being nice and supportive ü•π Yup I did consider working on weekends to fund my tuition fees after getting my student pass! I‚Äôm just afraid that I can‚Äôt graduate lol since there might be unforeseen problems in the future(regarding my family‚Äôs wellbeing), 4 years is a long time . But yeah since the post hasn‚Äôt been deleted by me I‚Äôm definitely still considering! I do look upon the opportunities I‚Äôll get being a NTU graduate , which is gonna be a big regret if I did withdraw Understandable! If I manage to get the study grant it‚Äôs actually S$18k and I‚Äôll be able to cover all of it with my loans/grants. Need to repay half of them after graduating. Unfortunately I‚Äôm an international student so I won‚Äôt be  able to work beyond 16hours/week, I‚Äôll try my best to work-part time. But yeah it‚Äôs still concerning to be a fresh graduate  and to compete in the field ! You‚Äôre so right! But it‚Äôs the hardest part which is kinda sad! I did put into tons of effort (travelling/interviews) to get the loan & award schemes so I felt so miserable thinking that I‚Äôll have to drop all the opportunities due to failure of the last step ü•π we tried most of my relatives and even some friends, even if they offered help it‚Äôll be bearing a condition( eg. lend them S$30k~50k). And I don‚Äôt think I should leave that burden to my mom it‚Äôs like almost her life savings‚Ä¶ Yup that makes sense! Better to be safe than sorry I‚Äôll look for other options first! Yup my relatives saw the liquidated damages and they‚Äôre afraid so backed up. That‚Äôs the main reason why I‚Äôm so frustrated throughout the progress! It wasn‚Äôt the first time tho since I need to get a guarantor for my half-loan half-grant scheme, so it‚Äôs kinda tiring > Especially we‚Äôre currently facing difficulties finding a surety for my tuition grant. Who is downvoting you??? üò§  why would a post like this deserve downvotes? 

I am sorry you are in this predicament. Are you sure you truly want to give this up? Is there no way you can make this work? üòî I feel so bad for you. Yes ! That‚Äôs the half-loan half-grant scheme I mentioned I received! They actually gave a lot and I‚Äôm grateful for that. For context it‚Äôs able to cover my tuition fees (if tuition grant is signed). It‚Äôs just things keep popping out and I‚Äôm not sure I can bear through all the stress and successfully graduate. I‚Äôm quite pessimistic about the future which is a me problem lol i‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in this position! maybe you can look into taking a leave of absence (LOA) for one sem (you won‚Äôt be charged for fees if u apply for LOA before week 3) to reconsider your situation and maybe save up a bit more before continuing your education. although this degree will open many doors for you, do consider what you want to do in the long run, and if you do decide to withdraw, make sure you have backup plans!! i wish you all the best Might have to sacrifice one of social life/grades/sleep but still possible to balance all 3 if you have proper time management Thank you! That‚Äôs my biggest concern right nowüò≠! Would look into it! Currently my mom said it‚Äôs not worth backing out rn‚Ä¶ so she said I should continue studying,but idk if it‚Äôs ok since it‚Äôs so stressful üò≠ Trust me, nobody is strong. But you did something brave and seek for advices. üëçüèªüëçüèª

Dm if you need to rant/ask anything, all the best! All the best to you.

This is not easy but I do wish success and happiness for you. By right you can‚Äôt work beyond that hours.. but by left.. can your mom sign it for u? Thank you for the kind words! I do understand why they downvoted me tho it‚Äôs such a negative rant üòÇ

Well the best scenario is that my mom managed to find me a surety, but in this mental state I don‚Äôt think I can perform well knowing it‚Äôs a big burden to others & there might be unknown difficulties that needed more in the future. I am struggling making the decision since NTU was my dream school but the safest option is to withdraw I‚Äôll say! 

Although still thanks for answering me! And don‚Äôt let it be a burden to you! Hi OP, sorry about your predicament. Unfortunately, our qualifications are nearly useless outside of Asia due to its recognition issues. However, OP u need to check the T&Cs of your loans properly. From your background, I believe you have the academic rigour in you given how rigorous your qualification can be. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to apply for that since it will affect my student pass/ loans, and yup I should secure a backup plan to keep myself on track! Thank you for your suggestions and words of encouragement! SAF 10th core value For tg, yes but they need two sureties. I was so shocked and troubled when they said ‚Äúit will be the best to find both of ur parents to be the sureties ‚ÄúüòÇ I guess OP's mom doesn't meet the guarantor's  requirements It's gna be tough to study overseas without financial security even if u do manage to find a surety. i think its best u cut the loss early than to incur more debt in the future. u can choose to work a few years and save up some money before enrolling into uni, whether its msia private uni or overseas. hurts to give up on your dream school, but it's really the best option for now Hey I just saw this post. I know you don't know me but I just wanted to suggest you to take some time maybe one day to just rest and meditate and enjoy nature. Starting a new course is overwhelming. As I write this I am starting one myself. But withdrawing from your dream school is a big decision and while mental health comes first, I hope you take time to rest and properly decide the decision. All the best and please take care


¬†- a fellow malaysian I hope that things will work out well for you, no matter what your final decision will be. Haha it‚Äôs fine I plan on working in Singapore after graduating so I‚Äôm desperate to get the NTU qualification. And thank you! I‚Äôm just afraid of the changes in academic language and content might affect my studies thus affecting my grades! I‚Äôm currently looking into future courses to gain a better grasp & consideration. I‚Äôm somehow more optimistic after ur words, thanks! Are you able to find any relatives to be your gurantor? Maybe sign a legal document that is binding that you will pay your relatives back on this sum in the event anything happen?

My cousin went to study in Australia and she took a bank loan for it. My dad had to be her gurantor (need to hit a certain income to be a gurantor which her parents didn't qualify).

Granted my cousin is very trustworthy. My dad never had any problems. After her studies, my cousin paid the monthly sum back, never defaulted (aka he never had to pay because she couldn't make a payment.)

You can also look at working part time while in NTU. There are lots of jobs in NTU for students to work at. For example receptionist. For example I work at Communication Cube and I was paid $18/hr to work there.

Good luck OP! ah i see, unfortunate but it's definitely a flaw in the system. i have heard of another story just a few months ago where op managed to get into local med sch but the dad refused to pay for it. they could afford the fees, but the dad didnt want to pay a single cent and refused to sign the loan agreement. not sure how it turned out but its another unfortunate case üòÆ‚Äçüí® Are you able to find any relatives to be your gurantor?

Good luck OP! Thank you for the advice! Yeah I find it so anxious not able to secure financial security since it‚Äôs a big consumption > income for my family. Since I can‚Äôt do much currently , it‚Äôs better that I made up my mind and just withdraw :3 You‚Äôre right haha I think the main problem is I‚Äôm stressing myself too much since I‚Äôve been working/studying nonstop without proper meditation. Will prioritise myself more,thank you! And all the best to you too! Wowie that was more frustrating. Hoping they‚Äôre doing goodü•≤ Not really since my relatives have their own family & we can‚Äôt gain their trust! Last time one of my relatives even offered to be a guarantor only if my mother lend him money lol

But yes I shouldn‚Äôt give up rn , we‚Äôll try our best to find a guarantor! Thanks! atb op, must be tough to make this decision but u can always reapply to ntu :) Think long term though, which course are you going into?

You can earn 4-5k after graduation and with career progression you can earn 8-10k going into your 30s

Are there any other ways to keep yourself afloat?
Do you have accommodations in Singapore? Noted! I think it‚Äôll be harder since I had to reject loans that I applied for and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll offer me the loan again, but still giving myself a little hope is better than nothing! Yup! I‚Äôm into econs.

The main reason I enrol into ntu was able to gain the exposure during internships as I plan to work here in the future ~ so long-term wise it‚Äôs the best choice ! 

But yeah my mom got a lil savings but I don‚Äôt think I should be selfish and take it all for my own good. And unfortunately I don‚Äôt have accommodations or what( I‚Äôm currently staying in hall) and it will be a high risk going through the unknown 4 years! 

Thank you for providing a new perspective to look into tho! I‚Äôll reconsider a bit"
Toilets at NTU ,"I'm a freshman at NTU for about 2 weeks and I notice that the toilets especially at South Spine always have a strong urine smell and sometimes they're being filled up with urine due to blockage I think. I'm wondering has it always been the problem since ages? Is the school management aware of it?

Cuz the toilets at my accommodations are ok, at least I don't think there's strong urine smell

It just feels so weird cuz a top uni in Sg cannot properly maintain the toilet cleanliness. I mean I understand it's not related to NTU department, it's more about what a toilet department will do, but if NTU wish to care more, they will care more about it

Just my opinion after spending a few weeks here. No hate, just a kinda weird topic sharing from a freshie  The longer in u study the more u will realise that NTU has alot of shitty areas, not just the toilets. Professors who teach but might as well dont teach coz they dont explain anything, high food prices, accoms prices, garbage service from OCH Housing and hall office etc

NTU is only top by name, the lousy things going on in the school never gets fixed unless it makes the news NS arc toilet is 100x worse than SS

Just an fyi :) Learn where the good toilets are.

Or the very least, learn the toilet people dont tend to use The smell in the SS/Arc toilets kinda accumulates due to high people flow; it's just how it is... they get cleaned twice a day I think as per regulations but with a throughput of a thousand people if not more a day it gets quite nasty...
Best alternative to SS canteen toilet is either the one in spms or the one behind NBS lift, always clean and smells more like dettol than pee;
btw also remember they wash them with bleach, and bleach reacts with pee to give
the infamous pee in the pool smell, which also explains a lot of smells in those toilets with high throughput I was undergrad student in NTU 2002-2006. Facility wise, it was top notch at that time. Not sure nowadays. Havent visited NTU since commencement you just need to find the better toilets are‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm gonna gatekeep where my recommendations are‚Ä¶ I was a freshman in 2020, peak covid period which meant lower student population too‚Ä¶ and somehow the toilets in EEE and SPMS are still clogged and full of piss welcome to ntu. try the arc toilets I LOVE no flush technology when u wanna use the in-built bidet and there is shit on the sprayer üíÄ never trust them unless they are the handheld ones Oh wow, I realized it too especially the OCH housing and hall office Oh my god, not to mention the overwhelming numbers of China tourists during peak school hours, TAs who ‚Äòteach‚Äô the tutorial by talking only to the whiteboard or computer screen, profs who don‚Äôt care or worse yet retort to students‚Äô questions regarding concepts via email, the absolute inefficiency of red&blue campus bus, and the garbage efficiency of NTU lifts‚Ä¶ üíÄ
Best method for learning in NTU is just huddle with ur friends and learn tgt, the school board we pay about 8-10k a year for cannot even be 100% trusted smh And Hive takes the top spot [deleted] Always use Arc basement 3,4 toilets 
Outsiders who come to Arc for events don‚Äôt know about the toilets on the research lab floors Visited the toilet today after my class, it seems ok, not that bad as previously Arc mens worse than hive Dont drag me into ur pee fetish sir Tbh, the lowest tut room lvl toilets are still fine

Same for Hive upper floors. Rarely people go past B1 Wk 1 less tut

Wait till wk 3 maybe"
Too add on to the bus drama,"I mean wtf is this. So if you have classes in the afternoon you‚Äôre basically screwed then. Walk in the sun -> vitamin D -> healthy livingüíØüíØüíØ Yea ur screwed. Better off walking down or leave earlier. Thats why I have been walking from hall to my classes because when you wait for the bus/board the bus and it reach your hall, by then you already reach ur hall by walking. The most annoying part is looking at the Campus Green buses... There are so many Green buses in the morn/afternoon... FOR WHAT Take grab faster https://preview.redd.it/ky4vhurht0kd1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84be66476e6a77a664ed1d7c68a83393d10edacc

lmao Might as well pay for monthly bus pass. Bus drivers currently on strike CC0005 takeaways Hey we need the green buses alright, the more the merrier >:) https://preview.redd.it/g0aofrf174kd1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b3bd210574285a355056d0a42ec21bad4b214a7b

Seems like it‚Äôs getting better now. ikr... I think it cauaed me to get a D for CC0005./s I can't tell if this is scarastic or serious. OuO"" what app is this? Update: I take it back. Two buses on the loop and a horde of students waiting.
Edit: One bus. Fr? Were your group mates leeching? uWave"
Top Tier Uni btw,"2 buses together during peak hour, people at NIE bus stop have to wait about 30minutes 

CDG is still fcking useless Might as well start a business with a car/van and roam around ntu campus letting *ahem* free rides at peak hrs ntu doing bare minimum. i saw 179 send out 4 buses in a row in the moring peak hour and same thing in the evening peak hour. there was even a lady recording the crowds. 

also, with the new building at gaia, students who have classes there can't even get on red bus since its the last stop of the campus and if they take blue, the rest of the stop can't get on. 

i think there's a need to rethink the route of the loops now I‚Äôve been wanting to move more and lose weight and the shit frequency of these buses have been the biggest inspiration for me. Yesterday I walked back from prime supermart to hall 11 on slippers and hands full of groceries cos I was frustrated by not being able to get a spot after waiting for 2-3 buses. Thanks NTU for helping me on my fitness journey‚ù§Ô∏è 2 buses is one thing, they're both on the same side of campus so if you accidentally miss both you gotta wait for it to make a whole damn loop, almost as though there's only one bus fr They really need to increase the amount of shuttle busses on the road during peak hour honestly. Everyone should just email directly to the president. Tell him that the number of busses reduces significantly after 5:30 PM. He may not aware this.  NUS actually ‚Äúfixes‚Äù the problem this week by increasing the frequency of the busses Normal... Last time I had 3-4 red buses clumped together at the opp side of campus...  
I wish they fixed it already and made it similar to the exam bus sched. Apparently NTU Students' Union are aware of the shit bus frequencies and sent us all an email stating that they will increase bus frequencies so I guess don't be too pessimistic YET (emphasis on yetüòè) So did we all just get the email regarding buses lile right after this got posted?üòÇ This has been the same since decade ago. I am surprised it is still not fixed to date. Even today it sucks I hate that the blue bus stop outside the NIE(?) building has two queue. One for the SBS and one for the blue bus.

And everytime when the blue bus comes, the people queuing the SBS will try to cut queue and ride on blue. Can have an on demand shuttle Continuous loop is a no go, dk where it will terminate FR NS prime or Can 2 prime? Would it be helpful if they could adopt a speed signalling system? Something where during peak hours, when 2 buses are (example) less than 5 min apart:

Bus 1 maintains a 50kph speed limit
Bus 2 is limited to 40kph to widen the gap

All this on top of increased frequency as a backup to prevent 2/3 bus 'trains' NS Having the buses start at different points in the loop should have a similar effect no? Nobbad Do you mean that buses of the same service (eg Red 1 and Red 2) start and stop at different parts of the loop?

eg. Red 1 (Hall 1 to Lee Wee Nam) Red 2(Lee Wee Nam to Hall 4/5)? Yeah kind of. Imo the spacing would be easier to maintain this way versus using speed. Hmm, true that breaking the service into 2 halves would alleviate bus bunching. 

But would this also create a lot of non-revenue buses taking up road space during peak period?

Eg. When they are travelling from Lee Wee Nam Back to Hall 1

Unless we also split Blue Service into 2 Halves. Blue 1 and Blue 2. Then once Red 1 Service Ends (Lee Wee Nam to Hall 1), the bus would change service to Blue 1 (eg. Hall 6 to NIE Blk 2).

But the second would mean Lee Wee Nam and Hall 1/Hall 4 would become a major ""interchange"" for those who want to ride from (eg. SPMS to Hall 11)."
UPDATE: they offered supplementary exam,"update from this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/hbJuEuSemW

unfortunately I failed, and I was like oh shit I can't grad..... I need to stay back just to remod ONE mod.....

I was at a loss, but I emailed my faculty anyway, and they said a supplementary exam will be held, and it's p/f only.

just wanted to let you guys know in case anyone is in the same predicament as me.

also, thank you for the nice and encouraging comments on the previous post! all the best everyone :) JY! Good luck for that paper and graduate with your peers! :) Good luck mate, please PLEASE study hard for that paper. Clear it once and for all.

Updates on bus situation ," Well at least it's better than the shit show over at the other University... Am I the only one who gave up on the shuttle busses 1 week into uni and just take 179/199. 

With that said, I do take the heartland shuttle buses though. Reliable asf but you pay with limited leg room. You post quicker than NTUSU noticed this bus issue. I recall seeing a similar email sent from NTUSU last AY on the bus situation. NTUSU has been in discussion over matters like these since the time bitcoin's price was 2 figures and we all know how such discussions always turn out.. i mean the school is the one handling the bus contracts and stuff right .. as annoying as this whole thing is i mean idk what is NTUSU suppose to do anyways, drive the bus? üòÇüòÇ all our collective student voice here or through NTUSU is useless if the school doesn't want to do anything about it shag lorh Average shuttle bus fan vs average 179 enjoyer In the future they should create a separate lane only for buses to exit/enter the campus for seamless travel. Cause in the evenings while exiting the campus, whole road is jam packed ‚ÄúMulti-factorial issue requiring a comprehensive solution‚Äù me when I ask chatgpt to fluff an icc essay for me Wonder if we'll see 3 door double deckers for 179. There is already limited space to turn left to CEE with a 12m bus As someone with 4/5 days on 830 classes - wk 1 and 2 8am campus red was literal hell.

But late wk2 onwards and today I feel like students have realised that attendance not necessary and a lot of the traffic has eased. Seeing fewer and fewer ppl in lecture too haha. Could have been just the usual start of sem rush. Aren‚Äôt they just added more and more excuses every year but nothing is being solved. Save this, see what‚Äôs the new excuses next year. Whoever in this sub said that NTUSU only ever responds after ppl make a lot of noise on social media was spot on. lololol what do they mean by ""identifying the peak hours"", it's pretty obvious what the peak hours are... you don't need a genius to figure this out We did it guys (hopefully) Wait and üôèüèº So now we have to scan in the bus rather than now which is just seamless can walk in ü•±üí©üôÑ Why not just have a bus dedicated for the tourists who don‚Äôt have to be with them how to get info on the heartland shuttle, i heard alot abt it Road not wide enough for 2 lanes going one way The choke is the PIE entry/exit. There are tons of heavy vehicle coming out of tuas/jurong which jam up the traffic light at the exit of NTU. Scroll down this [page ](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/life-at-ntu/visiting-ntu/internal-campus-shuttle) Idk why they change from 1 in and 2 lanes out of campus to the other way thx alot appreciate it üòÑ"

Well done CDG,"5 minutes ago the bus was 1 minute away

Now it‚Äôs 7 minutes away because 

1) bus driver decided to start the route earlier or

2) bus app is hella inaccurate New Time-travel University, also known as NTU, is a new university in Singapore. It is famous for its teleporting buses, which arrive neither early or late, but precisely when it means to. Occasionally, prisoners, also known as students, are seen boarding these buses, but never alighting. This brings about questions as to where the prisoners go.

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-NTU cannot be contained by any human means. Mobile Task Force New Time-travel University Subliminal Undermining, also known as NTUSU, has been deployed to NTU in order to slow down the spread by being as ineffective as possible. Thus far, the buses have been limited in number to two. Now if mothership can cover this then ntu might 'notice' the issue Speaking honestly, much better than a year before where buses would have difference of 20 mins+, and randomly end route on certain stops without informing. Id say CDG has been doing much better than the previous arrangement. Perhaps I was so relieved and am used to it now, so I cant find much wrong in it. But i suppose it could always be better haha. Could be both https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/s/ogZKHYvlpG this needs to be a thing If 179/199 can do it, why can't our buses Cope https://preview.redd.it/pdgu9v8o5zjd1.jpeg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4a70bd568df4b4f4030f343e77e4f2612f8b654 Time to develop it for a main stream SCP Just last week many of us waited >30mins because there were only 2 buses back to back in the whole loop On that note, SMRT is taking over 179/199 from September onwards over SBS Transit :) Casual ntu day ü´† fr though, it could be better. Just it used to be muuuuuch worse before like MUUUUUUUUCH worse, so for some its like heaven in hell üòÇ"
What are grads doing now?,"Generally, most articles that I‚Äôve read says that most degree holders end up doing jobs unrelated to their degree. My family and friends are saying the same thing to me. Im just wondering are there any NTU grads doing something different from what they have taken in NTU.(actually im pretty sure there are, i just wanna read the experiences) 
Was it what you wanted to do?
For those doing something unrelated as a job, did you regret taking what you‚Äôve taken in uni or feel like it‚Äôs a waste?

 Hey she is joy! He is sadness! And I‚Äôm jobless! SBS 2012 graduate üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Did terribly and finished with third class honours, took another degree in communication studies some years later and eventually an MSc in science communication. Now working at a research institute as a science writer. Between 2012 and 2022 I worked 4 different jobs doing publishing, copywriting and marketing in non-biology fields. 

I would say that the work I did after graduating aligned better with my innate skills, and it's something I am happy and comfortable doing. I think, and quite importantly, these are areas where I have ambitions and goals I want to work towards. While biology is a subject I have always liked, I found out pretty quickly that I was not cut out for the level of science/thinking/memory work my degree required. 

As to whether I thought my NTU degree was a waste... It took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I had gone and tried doing something I wasn't cut out for, but I've made my peace with it. I still very much enjoy biology but not in the way it was taught in NTU. The only time I felt gratified about my degree was when my hiring manager said I got my current job because of my NTU Bio Science degree. Life's funny, but it felt like everything finally came full circle 10 years later. Aerospace engineering, now doing additive manufacturing Science degree -> music teaching 

I would say it‚Äôs quite common for graduates to find a job that is not related to their degree, especially if their degree has very few jobs in the field upon graduation. 

However, uni didn‚Äôt feel like a waste because i could learn soft skills, especially in communication and time management. Having friends in different fields also means interesting conversations during meet ups! Bionengineering but now I‚Äôm teaching. Didn‚Äôt have a big interest in my degree from the start, just got it cause I wanted to have a degree moving forward 

Honestly I grew to love it over the past 4 years but I had made my mind to go into teaching and hence here I am Psych grad doing tech sales üòÇ good pay with lots of stress but I‚Äôd rather hustle in my early years than when I‚Äôm old [deleted] Used to do Early Childhood as a diploma but ended up in Linguistics for uni & now I‚Äôm doing comms for work lol ü§£ I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a waste because all these decisions ultimately opened the doors to whatever I‚Äôm doing now! Also, I didn‚Äôt hate what I was studying so I don‚Äôt feel that it was wasting my time. Quite normal to be switching out what you want to do because we‚Äôre not fixed human beings & can switch our interests anytime we want to ~ Jobless so frequenting the casino. Ntu cs grad here with second upper Studied mechanical engineering, grad in 2022. but currently doing project management for a logistics company.

Struggled through the last 2 years of degree and wanted to try out something different from my degree as I'm still not exactly sure of what I want to do in the long run NBS grad in 2023! Studied Business, specialising in HR and currently on my second full-time job after graduation as an HRBP!

Loving the vibes in my current company, and most importantly, having a good boss/mentor üíï. It really goes a long way in terms of helping with career growth and also blocking top-down management stress. A bad boss will only panic and keep stressing and pushing everything for you to do, hence why I left my previous job üñïüèº Sociology-> Accounting üòÖ English grad. In marketing now. I think some skills still apply like writing and research Mech engineering pass degree in 2021, went into finance middle office for stable career and wlb

Turns out it pays very well lol. It's the pay I expect when I hit 36-38 CS grad doing software engineering Graduated from NTU Materials engineering in 2016, working in a semiconductor manufacturing MNC. Doing well i would say, expecting 180k this year for total compensation. Work is about 50% related to my course of study. I'm poo Inside Out reference?üòÇüòÇüòÇ where did you get your MSc in science comminication? that sounds like an interesting continuation of your studies from a science background Hey yo sir. Me too. 

Mech eng ntu ' 22

Doing additive manufacturing a design. Omg reading this gave me so much hope! I have always aspired to do something music related especially music composition, lyrics writing and sound engineering. I feel very motivated now for uniüôè Again wouldn't be worth much since only top 3% of OF creators make most of the money on the platform Titus. how did u managed to land a job in that field üëÄüëÄ the company didn‚Äôt require u to hv prior accounting education? Is it tech related or more finance? Somewhat related. Sadness isnt a he. I got my MSc through a joint NUS-ANU Science Communication masters programme. It was a masters by coursework, and we were required to complete modules that were offered both by NUS and ANU in order to graduate. Unfortunately, NUS's FOS no longer offers this course and the programme has been shut down (I was in the last graduating batch), but I believe ANU still does. Nice nicee, feel like this is my calling rather than aerospace hahaha Awesome!! Since you‚Äôre so keen in music, do try to take up a music CCA in uni to be around with like minded company. If you‚Äôre going NTU, there are also music electives from NIE that you can take, for example music conducting. Not sure about music composition but you can refer to the NIE unrestricted electives list. 

Uni is really the best time to learn things if you‚Äôre willing to overload. I regretted not taking languages because it‚Äôs expensive outside to learn now.. and the pace is so much faster in Uni as private language centres will definitely prolong your course and milk your money from you as long as possible. Titus Low got graduate from NTU meh Hey there. It's just a finance role in a mnc. But puts me at top 5% for my age group at least aero industry tough luck and hard find for jobs, saturated with aerospace engineers, mirroring poly grad. In poly, mech eng also got more pay than aero. Unfortunate, aerospace is a popular degree in SG. You can try taking foreign languages classes at NUS CLS. Generally good feedback from my friends who have taken them (as alumni, not during undergrad days), and able to use skillsfuture credit to offset some fees too! OMG!!! Theres music electivesss nicee ill definitely try it out!! Thank you smm for this infooüôèüôè Oh thank you so much! Didn‚Äôt know about that! Will check them out :)"
What is the Student Union doing in regards to the shuttle bus situation?,"Hi guys, freshie here. I am under the impression that the student union is a student body aimed at improving student life. To what extent are they capable of improving the shuttle bus service? Seems like the most fundamental point of improvement especially with the increase in tourists etc. Do they have power? Can they advocate for such things? Otherwise, what's the point? 

Sorry if I come off a little strong, I'm late for classes cause of busses kissing each other üíÄüî´ Giving free bbt ofc Frankly the tourist situation isn‚Äôt as bad as it was in the past anymore, after going to NUS once i can attest to this. Its the large student population and the way they planned the routes that leads to this bus issue. 

But yea they still aren‚Äôt doing shit about this even after emailing everyone last week. Just keep posting here to get more attention to this issue they should host ntu fest in the shuttle bus This problem has been around for multiple decades. Don't be optimistic that it will have meaningful improvement before you graduate. Ask you to fill in the shuttle bus experience survey sent by email and do absolutely nothing about it. unlikely school will do major changes to the buses tho, I think they are waiting for the mrt... I woule rather they spend money send shuttle instead of spending it on the mid asf ntu festüò†üò†üò† Would like to invite anyone from NTUSU to provide their insights. Y'all advertise that the SU plays a part in improving student's wellbeing and student life in general... are you guys facing difficulties in getting this across to relevant parties? Or is there no attempt at all being made? How is it that a university, filled with intellectual people, can't solve  this issue?

I know some might say 'You say so much then you do lah' then my question would be which department does this fall under in the SU? This has been an issue since I joined ntu in 2015. What do you think ü§° It doesn't have 'power' but can be a strong voice to represent students to school's provost, dean's office, administration, and board executives. Email them and hope they will solve this issue soon. If ure late for class then go look at the bus timing and estimate. Leave earlier

Edit: typo lol Previously with Tong Tar Transport better? SU so busy dealing with their own internal drama you think they have time to solve the shuttle bus problem? Lol Not sure if the increased Hall fee made more students choose to travel to school which worsens the campus rider situation The point is that UG students number will reduce after first few weeks, while bus contract may subscribed yearly. The reason of reducing is obvious, that you can take course online‚Ä¶ In this ways only the greens are more important esp in the morning as the office workers in the university have to be on time. I laughed painfully at this Refreshing drink while walking to class. win win ü§£ ü§£ü§£ü§£ cc pre-course surveys: Sometimes u r unable to board both buses even if you get to the bus stop early, u have to wait for the only 2 blue buses to go one more loop after 30 minutes not really, it was worse in my opinion. The bus timing now is much more accurate and improved compared to when it was with Tong Tar (e.g. no bus for 30 minutes straight) Ooo what drama It happened to me so many times. Take 1 or 2 weeks to observe. If for example on the day where ur class starts at a not busy timing, tyt to leave. If it's during peak hours, I make a conscious decision to leave 1 hour earlier. I do complain about it but I take my own initiative to leave earlier for class ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I mean as a whole. SU generally doesn't have good rep"
What is your sure-fire (or at least reliable) STARS method,"I‚Äôve never won a single STARS in my life. Last sem I got zero core mods and had to add drop everything üò≠ please share how you guys get mods

Should I go to an internet cafe? Use two devices? Draw a prayer circle? üò≠ Make sure you're using Ethernet connection. Use [time.is](http://time.is) (it's synced with NTU server clock). Click and hold on the register courses button a few seconds before. Let go of button exactly when the time changes.

Have graduated and never lost STAR wars with this method. Login on the dot and press within 15 seconds, always worked bar once my screen loading for 1 minute before I realised something wrong

Eventually managed to get my cores, but not most preferred slots Do bookmark the [student intranet](https://entuedu.sharepoint.com/sites/student)

Academic Matters > Course Registration > Information and Guides > Undergraduate > Student Handboo‚Äãk on Cou‚Äãrse Registration

You can also try registering for modules at 5pm on your STARS date. Last time the method is to plug the lan cable straight into your com. If not, someone has said, press at 13:59:59. For me, I press at 13:59:59:60, in case the computer managed to receive my request quickly. If it happens, you will get an error message that you clicked too early. Panic next because you are much slower. I click register 1 second before my allocated time slot (eg if 2pm, click at 1:59:59), always works for me. Go go ntu library plug Lan cable. Use Microsoft edge. Standby phone if somehow internet jam.

But always have ur 3 plans on standby. Depends which day/slot u tryna get. The mon mornings would be less popular as opposed to thurs. I understand we have to submit 3 curriculum plans during stars and I read that it is recommended to submit as follows: 1st plan containing only your core. 2nd is your electives (ie bdes). 3rd a combination of both?

Do you usually do it in this manner? Wah you lucky üò≠ Why 5pm? Unless there‚Äôs some changes to the STARS registration that I am unaware about, you only submit one plan when you click the register courses button. The rest of the plans you make is for backup. Correct, because BDEs are allocated afterwards anyways, you don‚Äôt want to slow the process down of confirming the order of BDEs Because it will open again at 5pm. You can refer to the document I referenced for more info. Yes but BDEs need to order them, save time by adding them after you secure the cores and MPEs I just graduated as the final batch with the old GERPE system, so I am not sure about BDEs."
Why does south spine cheers grab and go charged me 20 bucks for UFO ramen üò≠,"So i followed the instructions and i dont have the fairprice app, then i used my debit card. I grabbed one UFO ramen and just went out. I realized on my apple wallet it says my purchase at 811 NTU is 20dollars?!?! How did grab and go works exactly and 20 bucks can def sustain me for 2 days üò≠üò≠üò≠ could it be a hold amount, maybe they will refund back the balance? It's a hold amount. They will refund back.

I experienced something similar where I tapped my card like 5 times, before they finally let me in. The hold amount was $100, but everything was refunded to me after 2 days iirc.

Tbh better to just use the app, I find it far more reliable. Literally grab and go Use FairPrice app, better and don‚Äôt hold the $20
Amt. I used the fairprice app about 2hr ago for one $2 item then kena charge $13.50 lol, maybe is the cheers problem? bro defo got robbed Eh how y'all use that ah? Psps i dont trust such technology.....

if no refund after waiting, try contacting their customer service phew!! I thought I was charged 20 bucks for $2 cup noodle....... Is it use the pay/earn QR code in the FairPrice app to enter? Economy crash price surge yes! rmb to add a payment method bfr scanning"
Why is SS caifan so damn expensive??? ,"2 chicken 1 egg 1 veg = $9.50 üòÇüòÇüòÇ what a scam 9.50???

Even outside cai fan stalls barely touch 7 with fish ‚ò†Ô∏è IüëèHateüëèSouthüëèSpineüëè The caifan price there is random one lol The food was extremely mediocre and cold as well. Please avoid. Tried it once and never again To scam the foreigner tourists that dont know better Taiwanese at south spine is also pretty shit ngl SS caifan fking scam bro. Actually the whole ss is a scam. Wouldn‚Äôt eat anything there except maybe china stall They often have those hidden cost items. That‚Äôs why I stop ordering that That‚Äôs why I rather eat at casual restaurants nowadays.A few bucks different but eat in peace. the ss caifan stall person once ‚Äútsk‚Äù and had this cold hard stare at me because i only ordered 2 veg and asked for more gravy ü§°, since then i have NEVER had caifan at ss any more The only redeemable store in SS is xiao long bao

Handmade noodle supremacy I usually order 4 dish and it never goes above 6. So idk what u doing wrong Got 1 Fish & 1 Egg for 7 before üò≠ u kena gan alr next time just walk away they r scammers SS caifan has ALWAYS been daylight robbery. Avoid at all costs. My friends and I used to joke about eating the grass at Yunnan Gardens cuz after buying SS caifan you'd be so broke Wooh.. what the heck is that mess close to $10 also kena scammed before hehe. try the chinese mixed rice at the snail soup shop!!! their portions are so much bigger, and their prices are almost cheaper I once ordered 1veg(kai lan) and1meat(steam chicken) for $4.8 Bloody rip off Aiyo 9.50 is actually such a ripoff I am shocked i like how out of all the recent posts, this is the most commented post.


that being said, i spent $5.7 on meat, egg and tofu and it tastes lower than subpar. never again. That food looks soo sad üò≠üò≠üò≠ This is unacceptable leh.. overpriced I'm surprised and not surprised at the same time. This is only my 2nd week as a freshie, and from the few times I bought from SS caifan, I made a promise to myself to avoid buying from them at all costs. The other SS stalls aren't cheap either. So I just buy food from near my home's hawker and bring to school, food is much cheaper and better. SS caifan is an absolute ripoff. I feel that NS Caifan price is also increasing no? Went ss caifan, charged me like 5+$ for 2 items. Sadge Just walk away üö∂‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è F Probably thought u rich China or Indo? They anyhow charge de. There's no set price for anything, they just go by feeling and mood. I've eaten there multiple times last year and it ranges from $5-7 and the things I got IS NOT WORTH $7. I've been warning people around me not to eat caifan at SS too, it's too much. They 100% scammed you cuz 1 meat 2 egg for me was $4.80 (whoch is already inflated af) 

So for $9.60 u could get 2 meat 4 egg lol Everything in SS is expensive ü•≤ Robbery. NS and SS caters more to outsiders but still robbery. However, whats not expensive? Maybe they also want to getok the ‚Äòtourists‚Äô. I don‚Äôt get the caifan stall hype it‚Äôs so bland bruh I prefer the Japanese stall anyday What's SS? The portions look huge though. The (work) location + rental are pushing the prices up in a way. The $$ gained by the rental is used for some other functions usually, but only the account folks would know more on the details and who authorised the financial movements. Cook yourself cb $9.50??

You can get fried rice from xiao long bao stall beside with portions enough to feed your whole family at $7... I was going to say like bruh for post-secondary/tertiary institution, maybe like $3.80 to $4 can la

Dude I can get this at an actual Broadway kopitiam at adult price for ... 1 meat 1 veg 1 egg is def less than $5. Maybe $4.70 HAHAHA

how does an educational institution charge double. $9.50 just go Macs and get McSavers and pile on your add ons la, can get 1pc McCrispy $2.60 yknow. Still got room to add Apple Pie (these are adulty outside-prices, not sure/maybe in schools it might have the 10% cheaper thing IDK I not sure)

Lol outside is if you put fish/ikan bilis/atas seafood then 1 egg 1 veg, maybe $6+ hahaha/ At that point the guy say 9.50, just walk away

Ur not obliged to pay Just reject the food. They have a price list that they're supposed to follow, and that's reflected on their billboard vouch Those nuggets remind me of the crap I used to eat during my undergraduate time in chinaüíÄ 3 veg, 1 meat? I once ordered egg + meat ,came out to be $5.50‚Ä¶ Exactly I got rice egg tofu potato and chicken and it cost me $5.80 Because everyone‚Äôs trauma bonding over being scammed hahahaah üò≠üò≠ south spine canteen Even MBS food court is probably not such a ripoff. This is not economic rice this is high ses rice Hahah yeah totally agree I once ordered the hotdog and potato, the la zi ji, egg and curry veg. 5.80 Oop I cannot disagree üò≠üòÇ r u handsome if anything i think is i ugly then auntie pity me"
Wtf is goin on in LWN stop,"S Why like so many ppl recently ah Many people wanting to get out of Pulau NTU after spending one entire day there. Evening class for Master students.
Definitely not because of over-enrolling students Anyone noticed more single deck 179 and 199 recently even during peak periods? Normal wait for the bus I thought the gates of hell closed 10 days ago book out smrt will definitely solve this issue !! holy crap As an outsider, taking 179 today inside NTU is bad. Can feel the frustration of all students. What‚Äôs wrong and is that always that bad? NTU is already at Pulau ULU I think 179 should be free for students who use NTU card Yo imagine once they change 179 179a to smrt then they use the super longggg smrt buses CCDS new policy and tourists  Looks like NTU postgrad degree is rly making bank hm, esp with china's degree inflation. Interesting. The solution is quite easy: more buses. Single or double deck doesn't matter apparently. No one wants to go upstairs. Last night 199 skipped my stop cause it was completely packed minus the 2nd level which was almost empty. 179 got single deck???

I thought 179 is all double deck sia Maybe SBS/SMRT could think of introducing bus service 189 to fill in the gap. But alas , the number is already taken Eh 10 days ago was 15th day of ghost month. Still have few days left Hope so Bendy bus pls ü´£ No harm trying Why smrt? 179 and 199 is operated by sbs as a student without hall (travelling home every night because of cca commitments), it‚Äôs super duper draining having to squeeze with these people. I just want to take 179 to boon lay int to change bus and get home‚Ä¶ while all these postgrads take to a stop just outside ntu‚Ä¶

I had to wait 1h to 179 last week because 6 179s skipped Gaia‚Äôs stop. Ever since i‚Äôve been walking from south spine to north spine maybe just for the stops within ntu? This doesnt solve anything. Kinda right but the key is to increase the number of buses Don't even need to look upstairs. Already encountered so many times where upstairs full and there are seats at the back of the lower level but some si ginna with their airpods or XM5 just standing in front of an empty seat while ppl trying to squeeze in. Mb lolll the roads here are way too tight for bendy, not to mention they are being phased out already 179/179A and 199 will be under SMRT from 1 sept onwards. Still ok actually. And nope, there‚Äôs still 40 running. You should have seen some if you been to Boon Lay, or CCK/Woodlands/Yishun or even Airport. Oh i see thanks! Is smrt better? LOL"
another SA case covered up by NTU?,"Hi. I was a JCRC member last year and nearing IHG I heard about a case in my circle involving one of the hall presidents committing SA on a hall resident.

I didn't think much about this case until my JCRC friends brought up the latest mothership article with the criminal verdict and it was so disgusting how NTU covered this up and let the guy get away scot-free? 

As hall council, hall safety has always been one of my biggest concerns. And it angers me painfully that this case was swept under the rug by NTU (inserted their Straits Times statement). 

Heard the update that the guy that committed this act is back on campus as well and allowed back into various CCAs. He even posted this awful caption that seeks to elicit sympathy and made himself sound like the victim. 

What's even more shocking to me is the amount of people sympathising with him in the comments because he's quite pops? Every single one of these people should be placed on a watchlist.  

Why do we keep giving major leadership positions in NTU to people of questionable character? And why did Mothership censor his name even though Straits' Times released it already? 

 Made this post because when I asked around JCRC, they said it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and that ‚Äúthe guy didn‚Äôt do anything much‚Äù. Wanted to see if my anger was me overreacting.

Also that freshmen are starting to get their halls soon so I guess I wanted to put out a warning to be careful of all these idiots roaming around WTF checked out his socials and got some club president commenting ‚ÄúI believe you‚Äù in his comments? How tf is NTU recruiting their student leaders

Apparently Ethan Ong also commented ‚Äúkeep going buddy!‚Äù üòÇüòÇüòÇ Wow, his post that you shared here is really nauseating. If he has a chance to go back to 1999, he should be telling himself to respect others, display better self control and never gaslight others. Honestly, I'm kind of not surprised. I stayed in hall myself, and I've seen posters advertising sugar daddys and posters bragging about being some ""underwear"" champion. I skedaddle out of there after the first year due to that--the fact that they could post such a thing just...openly...made me feel like it simply wasn't a safe place. Is there anyway we can blow this up and make this known ? I'm really amazed at how this case was handled, given that he was let off with a fine. He actually abused the trust that the friend had in him. Ngl, the comments on his IG post really disgusts me. I wonder if these people actually knew what happened.

I know this guy personally and tbh, never had good impression of him.

I hope u r reading this. You should be ashamed of yourself. [removed] [ Removed by Reddit ] WHO, name and shame pls What‚Äôs his ig The president balls shrinked and deleted his comment.

are there many malay / muslims staying in hall ?,"just like the title said \^ .   
  
for context im a malay / muslim girl matriculating this year and am keen in staying in hall , particularly w ensuite toilet if possible . however aft dg plenty research on the ntu halls via google , reddit , lemon8 & etc. idk how to put it but to be blunt i rarely see any malays in the photos and etc. nor do i see any making posts . 

quite frankly im an extrovert and i love to hang out w ppl and participate in the inter hall games and bonding etc. as it sounds fun , albeit i do prefer some quiet time alone as well . but when im reading about the halls and stuff , almost every single hall has like a drinking / party culture of sorts which im obv not keen in joining but abit fomo oso lol . 

but ya thats all , hope my post doesnt come off as rude or offensive as im trying to better understand if hall life is suitable for me . anybody can give me their input ? hall application closes tmr 5pm and ik i can just apply first but idrw to waste the application fee  hi, can't help u with the rest but u cant choose the hall u want in ntu, it will be randomly allocated. most halls afaik have shared common toilets, some shared among the whole level and some within a few rooms. atb :) * rest assured it is just a subset of the hall population engaging in the hall activities, be it drinking or just fun & games
* There is no mandatory activities as hall resident. You wanna use your hall purely for eat/study/sleep is entirely fine. You decide the hall life you want.
* end of the day, it is can be hit & miss or pure luck in trying to bond your hall friends. You will meet all kinds of people and relationship can be sweet, sour or bitter as time goes on. It is all part of growing up to learn and manage such life chores.
* Good luck! hi!yup there are some malay muslim people living in halls:) it's a little hard sometimes and there are not much halal food options but I like the convenience of staying in hall. You can join ntu's Muslim society if u want to look for more opportunities to socialise! Hello! I'm a y2 malay/muslim girlie staying in nanyang cresent halls! (the cluster with ensuite)

Honestly, you should apply for hall for the convenience & hall culture if you're keen to. Personally, I don't participate in hall stuff because I'm not interested in it lol (am more involved in Muslim Soc) but I'm sure people are nice enough to respect our beliefs. I do have some malay/muslim friends who participate in IHG and it went perfectly fine so don't worry\~ The drinking/party culture won't happen during CCA sessions but maybe afterwards or just during social settings.  


There are quite a number of malay/muslim people who stay in hall, I would think that we don't usually post it on social media haha. During Ramadan, I was fortunate to have a group of girl friends to sahur everyday & terawih with so it was a wholesome experience. Don't worry, you can always join clubs like Perbayu or Muslim Society to get to know other people too! (I am also an extrovert LOL)That was how I knew a few people who stayed in hall.  


Hmu if you have any qns regarding hall/halal food options/etc! InshaAllah we can get to know each other too. Enjoy your uni life\~ hiii im an incoming muslim hijabi freshie going to stay in the halls! we're definitely a minority but i hope that doesn't discourage you!! my friend roomed with a muslim, afaik he was the best random roomie he ever had. he woke up early at 4am everyday to pray but he never ever switched on the lights and was pretty quiet. ig if you observe the prayer rituals just make it so that it wont be that much of an inconvienience to your roomie :) just apply and have fun and make new friends! majority should be respectful of your beliefs and almost all hall activities DO NOT involve alchohol so please don‚Äôt worry about it. 

like others have said it‚Äôs a really small subset of people into the party culture. lol. source: i was one of them. lots of other hall residents just study hard and go for late night suppers etc. and parties/clubs are rare events for some people too, like maybe go once in a few months.

hall is fun and a great experience, don‚Äôt miss out!! hello i do see malays in hall! though its tough as halal options quite little, but there are people who stay here and seem pretty satisfied! Anyway u have to stay minimum 2 months only since thats the deposit amount, after that can leave hiiii i stay in hall 7 as a muslim guy!! it‚Äôs not a necessity to partake in all the drinking and stuff and its possible for you to hang out!! there‚Äôs plenty of activities that you can do that don‚Äôt involve them like sports and recreational games. In the event that you have fomo like me, honestly i just hangout with them! Like if they‚Äôre drinking, im there but i dont drink mhm!! in a sense its also good cos in the event something happens there‚Äôs at least someone who‚Äôs sober to take care of them yup. of course if you feel uncomfortable you dont have to partake in them. There‚Äôs always the muslim society and perbayu for you to join if you wanna mingle with fellow malays/muslims so thats always an option! if you do stay hall make friends and fond memories! i‚Äôve never regretted staying in hall especially since my hall has a lot of accessibility to halal food :) hello! im a malay/muslim and an ex-resident of saraca. i would say food wise, the saraca canteen has 2 halal stalls - indian food and chicken rice. saraca also has a dedicated halal microwave for muslims. last fasting month, there were some group sahurs even tho i didnt participate. apart from food from ntu, you can try exploring other halal eateries in jurong (that's what i did). I am, feel free to drop a text :) Hi hello .. I'm not a Malay/Muslim.. during my hall batch, out of 20, there was only 1 malay. If I recall correctly, he had problem finding halal food. 

But he was okay to eat non-pork food that did not have the halal sign.

best milo peng in ntu,"extras in my milo peng from tama canteen ü§©ü§©üòáüòá #whyntu Nothing like finding macro plastics in your drink when you were expecting micro plastics Maybe thats why taste so good, the extra ingredients Report to SFA bro. 8 demerit point offence First the Korean stall, now the drinks stall. Noo Tama canteen the chinese staff are really disgusting. The milo is sour and he dig his nose and scoop up the ice with his hands. That‚Äôs a macroplastic you have there Ntu is the best university in the whole wide world. I love NTU Don't forget about the SFA suspension last year ;) where is the tama canteenÔºü IT DID TASTE GOOD üò≠ but not the extra ingredient... Ya I should , also do I need to inform NTU's office about this too ? though i doubt they'll read my message ! What happened to the Korean stall?"
bus go brrr,"i <3 ntu Ok this one you have blame on sbs.
Ntu has no control over this as a recent graduate, enjoy ur time while u‚Äôre there, I kinda missed ntu, I miss the views. 

and just wanna say, damn bruh covid batch has it bad, covid, no hall life and graduate just before FGO. but this‚Äôs kinda life huh. I wish ntu buses were double deckers also.... Lucky I graduated already lol I graduated almost a decade ago. Back then LWN bus stop already having construction. Has‚Ä¶ it not finished construction works? The issue is so bad, I've been waiting since 9.30pm at the Gaia stop. There's over 50 ppl here that's been waiting for the same, and 4 completely full buses have passed in the past 45 mins. 

Doesn't Singapore have some regulation or data or expect this at all? As an international student I'm somewhat surprised there's not more collaboration to improve this issue. Currently debating walking back to NS just to take the bus there coz I can guarantee I'll be on..... Bring back memories haha. Glad to know the crowds still the same üòÇ Didnt graduate but left NTU in 2022.

Good Luck, hang in there. The worst bus stop in the entire country especially when it rains and you can actually slip and fall over there. Either that or its an oven when sunny. Sth beautiful about this photograph. It captures the essence of the evening commute but somehow, it doesn't feel congested. Lol I always take that bus from boon lay to my house n whenever I forget to get off at my stop I take a ride through ntu Back in the days it‚Äôs Leyland non aircon buses packed full of people struggling to go up the slope after NS. The joggers easily overtake the buses. nice photo Tbh, sbs is still doing better than ntu buses imo, I've seen them send empty double deckers striaght to north spine Covid time was the bomb, NS no queues, no one fight for bus, hall life is overrated IMO. No need to physically be present for class, the CCDS wet dream

LETS NOT FORGET THE SU SEMMMMMMM same I‚Äôm miss NTU too hahaha rly sad that I‚Äôm part of the covid batch too, but ngl after starting work i rly miss ntu Interesting. I had exact opposite experience so i dropped out Would you like to take another degree? Like masters? One can also deliberately extend to Y5. this would be a wonderful idea These construction works are newer, and likely for the upcoming Nanyang Crescent MRT station.

In fact, NTU is apparently getting 3 MRT stations throughout the campus. https://www.ntu.edu.sg/life-at-ntu/mrt-construction-on-campus/mrt-stations-work-sites-at-ntu#:~:text=There%20will%20be%203%20MRT,JW5%20(Peng%20Kang%20Hill)*. Just walk to crespion EVEN BETTER! They send some offservice to pass through NS to SS so that Gaia people don't suffer from full 179s!! They actually do their job Yup legit, see before But most of the empty ones are 179A üòµ‚Äçüí´ I wouldnt miss it tbh If you're willing to finance it I'm all ears <3 HUAT AH NTU! More MRT than NUS (only 1 station LMAO) Genuinely regretted not walking to NS to take the bus and will also genuinely consider walking to Hall 2 in the future since my school/lab is in NS (I'm a post-grad) Thats because they make money from them. People tap in. Whereas NTU bus is free usage. All 179As in evening peak start from NTU while some 179s come full from Boon Lay Be nice Crespion is closer to gaia than NS 

Or yea hall 2 Yes. The evening peak 179A will start from any of the 3 stops ; Hall 1, CEE or WKW(thus explains the empty off service buses skipping through the first few stops in NTU)."
home sick?,"have any other exchange students also had mental breakdowns suddenly come up from everything sinking in,  trying to make friends etc etc?
I had to skip class today cause anxiety was too much so I cried in my room all day (ik I‚Äôll get over it) just wanted to see if anyone else has felt like that ü§† as joel embiid mentioned above i had a super similar experience during army, first 2 weeks was horrid having to adapt to a new lifestyle and being shouted at by my sirs and sergeants and getting up at 5am in the morning. Shit was tough but once its time to go home ur gonna miss the times you had here. Best of luck and jiayou! I wasn‚Äôt an international student, but I did go through something similar when I first enlisted into the army. I was isolated on an island for the first few weeks, and I really missed my family and civilian lifestyle. It was tough adjusting to such a different environment, and I even cried at night sometimes. What helped me was staying in touch with my parents through calls and voice messages. If you're dealing with a time zone difference, maybe texting or sending voice messages/pictures could help you stay connected with your loved ones. 

I know adjusting to a new culture (especially Singapore, with how diverse it is) can be challenging, but don‚Äôt hesitate to ask the locals for help (they‚Äôre usually happy to assist). Making new friends takes time, and it's okay if it didn't work out initially. It might also be comforting to find others from your home country to form a support network. And if you ever need more support, the school counselling staff is a possible option, or you can reach out to me. I hope this helps, even if it's 0.01%... year 2 international student here. it happens for sure. the change between your home country and singapore is probably consequent (weather, languages, ppls behaviours, etc).

it took me a whole semester (if not a year) to adjust, i couldn‚Äôt attend any of my classes because of anxiety, exactly like you.

you just gotta try to stay possible as much as possible and get surrounded by people, (you can also reach out for counselling to the school if need to talk it out)
Make sure to make the best out of your exchange, visit around, try new food, discover new cultures, etc! 
good luck on your journey in singapore :) It will take a while. The initial weeks will be very tough. Most students need 10-14 weeks to adapt. 

Go do the things you like. Don‚Äôt just stay in your room. Go out, walk, eat, etc. 

It will get better. You will feel better soon. if u like cats do find them, theyll comfort u I dunno. Maybe I‚Äôm more mentally resilient and don‚Äôt experience such things. Maybe my upbringing wasn‚Äôt that smooth sailing. In your case I highly recommend getting into the various activities of university life (there are many fun groups). Keep busy and keep social as much as you can (if you are an introvert this is good training to prepare you for work life). Yea same, coming over here was my first time experiencing being in foreign country alone. I'd say the first 2 weeks were the hardest but get significantly easier overtime as you adapt and make some new friends here. Still miss family though but in a kinda bitter sweet way I try to have regular video calls with my friends and family there is really no shame to cry and let out your emotion, it feels really great and you‚Äôll want to pick yourself up and get on with whatever work we‚Äôve been delaying where is your homeÔºü JOEL EMBIID LMAO Thank you for taking your time to reply, sharing your experience and giving advice üôèüèº"
if you graduated today and lost your wallet at suntec:,"and bought a penguin at booklink at 1:18 PM today, i've passed your wallet to the Suntec City security office. you can find them outside the glass door beside the Goldheart near Suntec Tower 5.  Ntu lost and found telegram if you didnt already. Oops, wasn't aware of that. I'm not a student, just a random. If you could help me pass the message, that'd be nice. Thank you!"
just graduated :(,"i just graduated today from eee direct y2, with a gpa lower than 3. told my parents and my mom got very disappointed which is understandable, but she said one thing that i think will be a core memory ""atleast dont fail in your job too"". im not sure how to feel, on one hand im glad to have stuck through and pass everything within 3 years, on another, i feel ashamed of myself and deeply hurt by that one line she said.

And the job search isn‚Äôt going well either :( 
Any advice on securing a job would be appreciated!

congrats to everyone on their results btw!
 Hi there, NTU EEE graduated in 2022 here.

Your mum doesn't know what it takes to go through the EEE curriculum. Quite literally nobody I've interacted with from EEE over the years have ever said anything along the lines of ""Oh EEE was easy LOL""; it is always about reminiscing the pain we went through and complaining about the difficult days back then. For what it's worth, my parents say quite a lot of hurtful things to me even now after I've started working, but they have NEVER pissed on my university grades since both of them came from NTU EEE as well so I think they knew the shit I went through (ok but maybe I didn't tell them my grades also; just goes to show that not everything needs to be mentioned lol).

With the above said, take heart that you've survived really one of the toughest courses in NTU. The need for external validation is tempting, but always keep in mind that internal validation from the heart must always be the core of your sense of self-worth; anything and everything else should be viewed as an unexpected bonus. This applies to work as well.

P.S. after you get a job, please keep your salary number to yourself and don't tell your parents or you'll never hear the end of their comparison. Working life is hard enough as it is. You don't need to go home to another round of negativity after a long day at the office.

All the best! This time next year no one will care about your GPA anymore. My boyfriend GPA sucked too and he earned more than me now > i feel ashamed of myself and deeply hurt by that one line she said.

She doesn't understand the difficulty of one of the toughest major in NTU crammed into 3 years. 

Hey at least you graduated. Good job. I'm proud of you.

Do make an appointment with your CAO career coach to improve your resume. Graduating is a huge accomplishment itself, keep your head held up high and go celebrate man. you did great, bro! you've graduated from one of the toughest courses in NTU in just 3 years! I enrolled in EEE as a Y1 student and I'm barely surviving. Be proud of yourself. There's always going to be people who will put you down because they don't understand what you went through. Plus, your gpa won't be important once you get a job. Good luck! first of all, what is your mom's educational level. I told my mom to shut it when she said she was disappointed with my grades too. I'm not getting my honors as well but it was because she started flexing to everyone how her son got honors degree so she's paiseh now. She doesn't get to be disappointed. She never contributed to my studies so she really has no say in it. I'm proud of going through this difficult course and coming up in life.

As for job, first job won't be your last so don't be so picky if its not in line with what you've learnt or want to do. Make sure travel convenience and reasonable first pay. You pay will bump up with each new job you hop to. And after that, nobody is gonna even care what you did for your degree or how much you scored for it. dont include your CGPA in your resume and don‚Äôt mention it during interview if they dont ask about it

your gpa might affect the salary for your first job but after that no one will care your gpa in uni One reason to factor in when it reaches the hospice care age for your mom later.. 

Explore and decide what industry that you want to go into, either go through fresh graduate hiring rounds or do an internship then convert full time later also can. Hey, I'm entering via direct yr2 EEE, mind sharing with me the syllabus? Or what I will be doing in the first semester? Lol Ignore her, comparison is a thief of joy, you are already top 30% to be in local uni. Some of my similar age are still in poly/part-time poly. 

I am doing well and my dad also compare with other top flyer in newspaper, so fk them. I just stop talking if they dare to compare. Get a good job and then fail in your filial duties as revenge!!! My parents know my grades bc they force me to show them the sms that nus sents after every semester üòÇ

And for salary they also force me to show them my offer letter I graduated with FCH but I didn't tell my parents that because I know they will announce it to the whole kampung. However there was one time my godfather was critically ill and he mentioned he really wanted to see me in the convo gown, then I told him don't worry, my grades are quite good blah blah

The next day the whole kampung knew my GPA. urghhhhhhh why?!!!!! YOU BETRAYED ME!!!! Sadly, my mom is ‚Äúhighly educated‚Äù with a PhD.

I would say Y3 would be the year where most ppl‚Äôs GPA drops since most of the compulsory mods are killers and Y4 is more chill due to FYP (easy to get B and above) and if you choose easy electives. unrelated but as a FCH graduate, what study tips do you have? :D That's a tough battle. Best to just nod and say k can.
All the best to you op. I'm lucky enough to have parent that at least understand how different the world and education is now vs 20 years ago Goddamn! 1. do you learn best by visual/audio/repetition? only you will know which method is the best, but just to share a few examples from me and my friends: do revision in different locations - chapter 1 in park, chapter 2 in library, chapter 3 at home. when exam questions come out, my friend will try to recite the info from the same location. same mechanism why people make colour coded notes, or play different music when revising
2. mine is old school method - attend lectures and tutorials. during y1 when things weren't too hard to comprehend, i tried to read the notes before each class so i can follow the lecture flow better, but i gave up when my brain couldnt catch up. i print out hardcopy notes because i prefer writing the explanatory notes on the paper. i dont make summarized notes on a separate paper cos no time
3. 80/20 rule. the prof cant test you on every single thing. go through past years and midterm papers, some questions are more likely to come out.
4. i used spaced repetition when i planned my revision schedule (usually 1 month before exam). eg if i have 5 days to prep subject A (exam on day 6) and subject B (day 7), my schedule would look like this: day 1 - B day 2 - B day 3 - A day 4 - A day 5 - blank (always leave blank), skim through whatever you have read, at this point you dont want your brain to be too tense and stressed day 6 - B
5. rest well before exam day. even saf tells you 7hrs of rest is important thanks for the tips! when do you recommend doing pyps? During the revision period - 1 month before actual exam. Space them out."
"just graduated from business without a job, how cooked am i","as title says: i just had convocation, degree conferred in June. i have been applying jobs at a relatively slow pace compared to peers (those 80-200 applications) as I wanted to take a break after exams ended in May as I was borderline depressed. i know many started applying before their last sem even started.

I graduated with 2nd upper (BA) and had one internship in a bank.

how‚Äôs all your job searching going? at this stage do you have any advice for me? how cooked am I. 

any help would be appreciated.  My only advice is (Looking at my friends cos i extended), you might have to lower ur expectations a little and look outside of the jobs u rlly want job market is really bad now, it took me 6 months to find a job with a cs degree after sending out 200+ applications with 10-15 interviews and one offer. 

i think you have to lower your salary expectations to land a job fast and imo it's a numbers game (start mass applying to jobs) It‚Äôs ok to take it slow. Don‚Äôt need to compare to peers, stay in your own lane and see this as time off. I would also try internships - it‚Äôs a low risk trial for both employer and employee. If things work out ask for a perm role after 3-6 months. That was the start of my career and now I am satisfied with where I am even though I was considered a ‚Äúlate start‚Äù compared to peers. Good luck! Happy to DM if you want more advice or coaching Hey no worries man. I graduated from NBS in December last yr and was also unemployed for about 5 months. Of course it took a toll on my bank account, but also gotta understand that the job market isn't the best rn. So try your best to find opportunities that will suit or benefit you or where you are best fit. Don't undermine yourself but don't over-expect as well.

Also PSA that there's the annual NTU Job In-Fair on 22 and 27 August so maybe you will want to head on there and speak to people for job opportunities.

All the best, cheers!‚úåüèª A HR here. Honestly, the job market isn't as bad as how people perceive, BUT it depends on which industry you wanna head into. Of course, you gotta know that many jobs out there looks at experience more than just a mere degree cert with 1 internship. Also, how you perform in the interview is also quite crucial. Don't over promise but be confident of what you can do. Also, in certain parts of your interview, it doesn't hurt to be a little honest. Afterall, you're a fresh grad, over promising on certain things will kill. 

Anyway all the best in this journey! (I started my career probably 2 years after i graduated too. It will work out somehow.) Let me be blunt a little: 2nd upper + only one internship puts you behind the rest by a lot. Most business graduates I see have at least 3 internships. Also you started applying late, which means you missed out on many opportunities already.

Advice: 
- If you are really desperate for a job, apply to ""less known"" companies who offer lower salary ranges. (I mean beggars can't be choosers)
- But if money isn't an issue, you can consider working odd jobs/ temp jobs/ contract jobs for the next few months then apply for jobs that starts in 2025

All the best to you. The job market is really bad right now especially the mass hiring that happened during covid. Companies are more focused on cutting costs right now. depends on how urgently you need a job. if income is not an important factor for you, then take your time. otherwise i‚Äôd say try different jobs ‚Äî an experience is better than nothing at all. 
i grad with a biz deg from local U too and ended up in customer service. love it and wouldnt trade it for anything. if money isn‚Äôt an issue, just take things in stride. it‚Äôs your last summer ‚Äúholiday‚Äù, spend it well and cherish it! you‚Äôll miss it when you start working. don‚Äôt pressure yourself too much For me it was relatively okay. I graduated in Dec (extended) but just that after Uni I had an identity crisis, not too sure what I want to do next so I applied jobs slowly and went for interviews. If I get, I get, if I don‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt care. I didn‚Äôt settle down to a role in a department that I want until recently. 

Take your time. This is your first job anyway before being a full adult. 

Btw you can always fall back on the bank you interned at, connect with them again and ask if theres an opening etc, because from what I heard, even if it was in a diff department they can slot you in if there‚Äôs vacancy. A word of advice: apply to the business dept of non business companies, for a business role. They are more inviting than the already saturated business companies and they tend to invite for interviews more readily. That's the thing that comp science grads miss out on too. You do not need to work in a tech centric company. Work in a tech role but in an engineering or manufacturing company. Your role is valuable to the company and it's harder to replace such roles, compared to easily redundant and saturated roles in tech centric companies. Startup owner here, some advice on how to stand out:

- Find individuals from companies in sector you are interested in LinkedIn, tell them you're fresh grad and looking to break into the industry. Even if not direct hits, they can help guide you in terms of where to look, how to pitch yourself
- Be nice to HR people but know they're not decisions makers. 
- If you do get an interview, call the interviewer a few days later on your thoughts about the biz. 
- Ask every relative to introduce you to 3 people in their network who might be able to help. 
- Go to industry mixers and meet people. 
- If it's a startup / SME, go in person, say hello and drop off your CV. 

Applying online is the most saturated channel as everyone does it. Of course do it, but explore higher effort job search channels b/c others won't be bothered to even try. 

Hope this helps. Happy hunting, it's part of the journey You gonna live till 80, minimum. That's more than half a century to be dramatic. Do you wanna live this way? A HR here. Honestly, the job market isn't as bad as how people perceive, BUT it depends on which industry you wanna head into. Of course, you gotta know that many jobs out there looks at experience more than just a mere degree cert with 1 internship. Also, how you perform in the interview is also quite crucial. Don't over promise but be confident of what you can do. Also, in certain parts of your interview, it doesn't hurt to be a little honest. Afterall, you're a fresh grad, over promising on certain things will kill. 

Anyway all the best in this journey! (I started my career probably 2 years after i graduated too. It will work out somehow.) Reminds me when I graduated from MPE in 2000, my peers mostly got a job before they graduated. 

By July, my mum panicked and went around asking relatives to help me. I also got nervous and run out of Money. I had to go temp here and there. 

So I started later and only started my first job in September. Surprisingly, I actually gotten 3-4 offers suddenly. Sadly I made the mistake of rejecting ExxonMobil. A regret I carry for more than 20 years. Have a couple of friends who took 1.5 years to find a suitable job. Depends on your finances. If family don't ask you for money then there's no rush to start working. thanks!! have been actively keeping a look out ü•≤ Did u felt that u did decent or relatively good in some of the interviews, yet they still didn‚Äôt give u any offer? I have been having such experience, and it‚Äôs demoralising to some extent, is the competition really so cut-throat? thank you for the advice :‚Äô)) Damn brother I have been searching for months as a CS major and no one is willing to give me a job. 

Lucky I have a sexy gyatt and am able to survive selling feet and gyatt pics on onlyfans. Fml man no way.. you couldve just apply for a job at your internship compamy and they will accept you most of the time thank you for the reassurance !! i appreciate it lots, will drop you a DM thanks for the advice and encouragement!! may I ask what industry you were looking into? what are the detriments of the gap in the resume of being unemployed? thank you once again üôèüôèüôè thank you for this :‚Äô) EDIT: To anyone reading this there's a reason why NTU only mandates ONE internship. Enjoy your youth rather than participating in this silly rat race and getting fear mongered by redditors here if you are content with an ordinary life.


One Internship is definitely enough. Also it's not the quantity it's the quality. Other factors such as luck should also be taken into account. I have friends who got a job without doing any internships, friends who are still unemployed despite doing a gov-related internship.

This Internship rat-race is gonna drive everyone insane or into depression sooner or later. Second tier job those jobs tech jobs in non tech companies are lame i believe that i did ok to decent in most of the interviews and most of the interviews i went for are all for below average salary for a cs grad (mid 4k range) so i do believe that its bc of the bad market and oversaturation of cs grads, some of my nus cs friends with good grades are also struggling to find jobs so its definitely tough out there 

i was lucky to have landed my current job after so long and i feel for you bc i experienced the exact same demoralising job search process, just gotta keep applying everyday and not give upüôè Brother my internship company shat on me and offered me 2k. I was like fuck this shit man I can earn way more on onlyfans No problem!

I was looking into the marketing industry/field (but ultimately my current job isn't in marketing üëÄ). There were jobs but they were all sales commissions (no base income). But given the volatility of the economy, this was definitely not a safe choice for starting out.

I feel that in the past, many people will think a gap in your resume may mean you're slacking off. But that's a very stereotypical and dated idea already. Many of us know that the job economy is super bad so I think it is less frowned upon (since it's a common and visible phenomena). When your future employer asks, you can just be frank with them that you have been finding a job. But if you feel uneasy, you can always sign yourself up for Coursera or online courses to upskill yourself (perhaps something you're interested in or the path you are looking to pursue. For marketing students could be like Google Analytics etc etc).

Hope this helps, cheers! ‚úåüèª Disagree. Internship increases your chances. Similarly, i've also seen a lot of people becoming jobless when graduating with 0-1 internship, and also friends working in govt jobs with multiple internships.

But agree on the part where luck is a factor. If anything, I'd argue finding a job is 10% achievements and 90% luck. Well if you need a job and don't want much competition, these are worth looking at. And MNCs do pay well for such jobs too. The hard truth is the comp science grad market has been oversaturated for the last 3 years yet people are pumping more and more into this market. And that's what's pushing the opex cost up for tech companies, prompting them to either cut jobs or move out. It's a vicious cycle that most people aren't realising at this point. Thanks for sharing"

CHC was one of the shuttle bus terminals Hive road is not too small for bus otherwise heavy vehicles can't enter for maintenance as well. Buses can easily enter Hive carpark where it would be possible to build a bus stop there. 


The problem is the 'bridge' of S3 and S4 over the road where buses are too tall to pass through onwards to Admin Bldg Yeap, or Opp Yunan Just walk out to that bus stop opposite city harvest Actually it doesn't need to pass through S3 and S4 or enter the Hive carpark, can just make the buses do a u-turn [using the bay in front of SOH/CHC building](https://www.google.com/maps/@1.3430152,103.6836986,3a,85.3y,12.69h,82.81t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s8nKeiN2C13GR_fxJ3C_GXQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3D8nKeiN2C13GR_fxJ3C_GXQ%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D218.55307%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192?coh=205409&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MDgyNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D). Can build a bus stop there too. 

Still much closer to Hive/SS than the current Gaia bus stop. Single decker still can what SOH/CHC can indeed be a potential stop since it also serves The Hive nearby, but where else can this potential bus route serve?

The low clearance of S3/S4 ""bridge"" is the main obstacle, otherwise it would have been so much easier to go from UHC/TCT LT through the road to the Hive, plus it's a shorter route to the south spine. Definitely not possible. Only minibus can pass through Its that low?"
ntu's hall office is the WORST ,"This time last year, everyone got their waitlisted hall results on July 3. Now, it's freaking close to the move-out date (July 15) and we still have no update. Nobody has replied to my tickets in one stop and emails for more than a week and nobody is even picking up the phones in their office when I or my friends call.

What do you expect international students who left their homes, parents, friends, and everything we knew to move to a completely new country to study at NTU and this is how we get treated for basic housing... 

This makes me regret choosing NTU and makes me hate their bureaucracy, inefficiency, and idiocy when addressing the basic concerns of students. 

  
Is there anything you guys think can help me?

PS I have 7 hall points Anyone with 5 points who havent got the email? Hey man results just came out for me. All the best for you and hope you got a hall! 5 pointers wya! LOL! :') feeling the same here, an international student too. I saw another post about one guy getting a hall offer on 4 July with 5+2 points (willing to share) tho. Still waiting for a reply from here... It‚Äôs been 3 weeks and they still haven‚Äôt replied to my ticket either. Called the hall office  regarding other matters and they kept saying they are unable to help, kept pulling up ‚Äúpls refer to the FAQ‚Äù. They even hung up on me the first time I tried to call them and only answered when I called a second time.
Love the hall office, paying so much for hall fees and the office is useless. Same. Got 2 cca rec list and Im here begging to be returned to my old hall and no reply for like 3 weeks now. :( I got with 3 points [deleted] Fellow intl student here too, thats why they let you know that you should look for alternative housing options in advance and not rely on the fact that you will get hall.

BUT we can only know the details on July 18 yeah? So do we move out on the 15th or what üò≠ Omg like finally üò≠üò≠üò≠ Hi can i ask if u appealed earlier? I got 5 points but didn‚Äôt appeal, now haven‚Äôt received any emailü•≤ not sure if just pure bad luck the system is so unreliable and when you atleast reach out to the people in their office, they just go MIA or give standard template answers Holy moly which hall did u apply for You can write in to move in on 22 july, moat of my friends are moving in on that date and guess what.. my friend just got her hall acceptance email this afternoon and she alr paid a 12 month lease for rental outside campus... what will she do now? i blame NTU and their lousy system. I dont see problems like this w my friends in NUS and SUTD I think we can just stay in our current hall until the 18th? Cuz we got a hall for next acad year right so shouldn't be a prob...? üò∂üò∂ü§£ü§£ at least that's what I will do cuz checking out for only 3 days is too troublesome üòÇüòÇ From what I've seen the most they will do is charge double for overstaying so an additional 3 days rent which is still acceptable imo I didn't appeal but got the email... it must be their screwed up system at fault. you wanna try spam calling the office before they close today? Hi I did appeal a week after receiving the waitlist email. Not too sure if it played a part but perhaps u can try calling or emailing hall office. Atb to u! Are u an international student too? Cuz maybe they prioritize international students first within the group of students with 5 marks? I'm sorry what, I don't think you have to pay the entire year rental charges anywhere in Singapore (except for unis, where you at most pay for a semester). Here, you pay 1 month deposit for a 1 year contract and 2 months deposit for a 2 year contract. I think your friend has simply been taken advantage of...¬†

Also NUS has a way worse system, with even less housing options available since you give their example. There is always some form of RNG involved in systems like these (sadly), some people get fortunate with getting hall and some don't. So I don't think comparing their situation to yours is a really a good comparison since there are so many factors at play. Anyways, the problem is just far beyond the housing office. Since the end of the pandemic, admissions in NTU have been on the rise each year, which means more and more people would need on-campus housing. Then there is the policy of guaranteed hall stay for y1s and y2s, which means it puts ppl like us on the lower priority. Then there is also the ever-increasing amount of positions in SAO-affiliated clubs, and getting 5 pts now requires minimum effort, which leads to an artificial inflation in the number of people with hall pts now competing against each other. So are you going to blame all the people behind this?

I understand your frustration and have been a big proponent of ""intl students should have priority for accommodation"" myself, but this is something which is flawed with the upper mgmt levels of NTU itself. Hence, that's why being mean to low-level staff isn't really going to help (I'm sure they are also trying their best to get back to everyone one by one), since all the fault lies with the upper mgmt.

In the end, it's at least better to have the security of having a roof over your head rather than nothing at all. I do feel sorry for your friend since they must have panicked from all the stress that this was causing and fell into a trap of having to pay 1 year worth of rent in one go. Again, I'm not saying to completely give up on getting hall, but not rely on it since it is about as predictable as NTU's grading system :p.

I wish you good luck in your search for housing and hall allocation results and I hope you get through it! Yep, will plan to do the same too. Can't be bothered by how stupid NTU plans and execute things anymore But the check in dates will differ tho, even if you get hall by July 18, most likely would only be allowed to check in by August .... What kind of reason did you give for appealing? I am.. a friend of mine with 5 pts also didn‚Äôt get the email Also got the offer js now, called the hall office and they said that I can stay in my current room until i get the key. Finance issues as well as contributions to ntu That's weird. I got 5 points too but I got appealed at the start of July, maybe that makes the difference? Idk Thx for the info üôèüôèüôè Did you provide documentation Yes after they asked for it. They never replied after I sent it though"

regarding hall 16,"A friend mentioned to me that a former president of Hall 16 was recently convicted of a sexual crime.

 Shouldn't that make it the safest hall now instead? fella went to touch someone's balls from what i heard. he got evicted from hall alr... There are sexual predators everywhere in halls, clubs, and other places just that you dk only.

sleeping in ntu overnight,"anywhere in school (other than halls) where i can sleep at overnight with aircon? i want to spend the night in school during orientation camp [deleted] You can go find a friend/senior in ntu and do a 1 day crash in their room. unlocked lt, arc trs (u may be kicked out by guard), ns/ss trs 

also u may need matric card to access some trs As a professional school sleeper, let me share my experience

https://youtu.be/5pPRowSfjaE?si=9c0DlFH6I7JE7UfN Honestly, I think you can just ask the camp organisers if they have any place for you to sleep. They sometimes booked out LTs just for this purpose, just bring your own sleeping bag! most camps know it's hard to get back at this timing and rather you have some sort of supervision than stay somewhere unaccounted and risk something happening to you in school grounds.

Apart from what have been mentioned, air-conditioned lobbies/corridors (near LWN or at EoS) are good choices and are accessible, albeit hidden, if you don't mind a little white noise in the background. In general, there are a lot of air-conditioned places, you just need to know where are the discreet places/where to stay hidden. the routes the guards patrol are fairly predictable and they rarely go out of the way to chase you if you stay out of their sight.

if u don't require aircon, there's actually a lot more comfortable and discreet options where you won't be disturbed. Why? You already have a hall room LWN LT 2nd floor, CCA club rooms Arc. Guy or girl? If gal, can come my hall sleep i got spare bed ohh! may i know which LT? cus i heard that some of the LTs' aircon will be turned off after 12am :( no eh i don't, its not a hall camp [deleted] ahh i see, thanks!"
"to those still looking for a job/struggling in school, don't give up!","a little bit of background: graduated last dec 2023 from Engineering. TLDR, didn't enjoy my degree at all, struggled my 3.5 years (even though i'm DY2, extended another sem), had to take supplementary papers after my last sem because i failed 2 mods. graduated with slightly above 2 GPA.  
  
started job hunting only in march (yes late, because i wasn't even sure i could pass my supplementary papers). i wanted to pivot out of engineering because i was very sure this wasn't what i wanted to do as a career. i have a keen passion in business operations and strategy, liked the idea of rotation thus applied for mostly graduate programs and management associate roles! 

some background about myself: in my 3.5 years in engineering i only did one professional internship but i mentored and volunteered for a non-profit organisation consistently (weekend and weekdays) for the last 4 years. was in a sports CCA and played SUNIG and IVP. 

sent out close to a 100 resumes, but each of my resume's objective was curated to the role/company i applied. landed about 5 interviews, 2 of which proceeded to the final round and i was finally offered a MA role for a MNC :') 

nothing to boast, in fact this whole process was full of doubt and many what ifs (what if i changed my course, what if i took up more internships etc). to all those struggling in school, YOU WILL MAKE IT. a bad grade isn't the end!!!! attitude is key and what employers look out for, how you carry yourself is important. uni isn't easy and don't do it alone.

tong tar was worse but this isn‚Äôt good either,"I‚Äôve written in numerous times over the years but they always give the same reply.

Wrote this email on the 199 bus because the wait was really not it üò°

If anyone wants to write in as well, their email is shuttlebus@ntu.edu.sg

Maybe they‚Äôll finally do something if enough people spam them  My speculation is that when the university signed a contract with comfortdelgro, it was for a few years, and it would very difficult to change the arrangement mid-term. The university may be able to negotiate a better contract next time. I stayed in Hall 10 from 2004-2008. Before my stay it was bad, during my stay it was bad, and after my stay it continued to be bad. They keep saying they are looking into it and every 2-3 years they‚Äôll just wayang and rotate the bus routes and claim that the new routes will improve the frequency. 

Then the current batches would graduate and new students would come in with no knowledge on the history so they can just rinse and repeat. Rectified. Understood the OP‚Äôs statement. At this point I think it‚Äôs more an overpopulation issue than the buses NTU requirements are strict since day1, financial criteria etc. must be met before being awarded the contract. Due to this only a handful of big private bus operators are eligible. Other than few usual suspects there isn‚Äôt any competition in the market, of cos your service standards drop with the lack of supply. don't bother, they'll add more buses after we graduate ü§£. Power is within upper management, not students Was not Tong Tar the company behind a GRC‚Äôs ahem.. shuttle bus service? Do these contracts usually have non-compete clauses? Is this why NTU can't also have separate contract arrangements with other local bus companies ongoing at the same time?

^(Or NTU just being stingy and don't want to spend more money on shuttle buses lol) I wrote to NTU about the NTU shuttle bus. I gave up waiting for the shuttle bus and took the 199 when I wrote the email. https://preview.redd.it/bzun6ikuuykd1.jpeg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7d769a0c170233b8742ad57f10eb784faa8cb955

I‚Äôm sure NTU regulates the student population, so that should have been taken into account already.

How is everyone leaving NS in a 15min block supposed to fit on 2 buses (1 blue, 1 red, assuming they both run on the same schedule) ü•≤ i think the new mrt line will be constructed by then LOL, at least would solve some congestion on campus rider A lot of the problems in the world can be solved with money.

There‚Äôs no non-compete but if you have 2 buses coming at the same time, then you have a bendy bus with extra steps. If you have a more than 3 buses or more coming at the same time, you have a MRT with extra steps. The university certainly has a (kind of) fixed amount of budget for shuttle buses. Of course if they double or triple that amount, it can probably solve the problem... Just throw in more pictures whereas possible. Spamming them text won‚Äôt help much.

But end of the day, i don‚Äôt think CDG will turn down any additional request. They have done it well for Exam period last sem for the first time. So I believe it‚Äôs NTU side that have the problem.

Meanwhile, just appreciate the fact that we are not alone.

https://preview.redd.it/i04tc2jclxkd1.jpeg?width=1290&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9b1194b62279e606dfa0e3d8e7e4dcfc3ea138f Lol then it is just simply a stingy problem, not a legal problem 

Back in my day, it's not uncommon to see three ~ five bus 179 all come up in one shot. There's always a seat for everyone. But NTU shuttle buses always has been a problem due to their low frequency and high passenger volume 

Plus I'm sure it's not a money problem. Look at how expensive the tuition fees are, especially for international students. Now multiply that by the hundreds or even thousands of students across different faculties and majors. 

Even after deducting the costs like paying for the lecturers salary and whatever, don't tell me they don't even have a bit of money to hire extra buses and bus drivers which is a very tiny cost compared to the other overall costs as mentioned above Tuition fees are obviously regulated by MOE - the university does not really have much say on that.

But it is likely that when the university was negotiating the current contract with the bus company, it did not anticipate the recent increase in the number of students >Tuition fees are obviously regulated by MOE - the university does not really have much say on that.

You are clearly talking out of point. The topic we are discussing here is not who or what is deciding how much the tuition fees is. We are talking about ***what*** **they are spending on** *after* collecting all those tuition fees. Spend hundreds of millions of dollars on a mouldy building? No problem! Spend a tiny fraction of that amount on more buses and bus drivers to improve the quality of life of students and NTU staff? Nah, not gonna happen.

>But it is likely that when the university was negotiating the current contract with the bus company, it did not anticipate the recent increase in the number of students

I doubt that is the problem. Firstly, the number of students per major is clearly indicated in the NTU IGP as you can see here: [https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/oad2/website\_files/igp/ntu\_igp.pdf](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/oad2/website_files/igp/ntu_igp.pdf)

NTU literally controls the quota for each major intake. So they definitely know exactly how many students they are having in total.

Secondly, if their contract with the existing company is indeed fixed, then why not just hire more bus drivers and more buses from *another* company to meet the new demand? It can't be a money problem as I mentioned above. NTU has a LOT of funds to build expensive buildings, yet refuses to have more internal shuttle buses for both their students and staff? The rise in tuition fees is definitely based on the rise of the cost of operating a university. Otherwise MOE would not increase it that much. I believe this has been calculated.

Well, I was thinking about master's students instead of just undergraduates. I think MOE has been encouraging the universities (including NUS) to run more master's programmes to increase the revenue because they cannot give that much money that is needed by the universities, which only means that the cost of operating a university is even higher than what has been taken into account in the tuition increase.

> It can't be a money problem as I mentioned above. 

It is more likely to be a money problem. As u/Far_Specific4836 said above, most problems are money problems. >  NTU literally controls the quota for each major intake. So they definitely know exactly how many students they are having in total. 

My understanding is that there is a directive given by the MOE and NTU is trying to match the number. Having much more or much fewer than the directive number will cause problem to NTU on the MOE side. The tuition fee already increases almost every other year either way to take into account increase in operating costs, yet the NTU shuttle bus problem has still been around for many, many years.

So a top national and Asian university is too stingy and lazy to solve this problem and refuses to hire a few more shuttle buses every day (yet surprisingly 179 has very high bus frequency LOL) but still willingly dump hundreds of millions of dollars on wayang buildings ü§ó

EDIT: NTU is absolutely stingy and refuses to solve an age-old problem despite the solution being very simple and only costs a tiny fraction compared to other wayang stuff they are doing. So, I end my conversation here as I have made my points very clear. I won't read nor entertain anymore comments after this. <3 Good what, the school benefits for itself"
we‚Äôre considering starting a 24/7 unmanned instant noodle store in NTU ‚Äì would appreciate some feedbacks!,"Hi, a group of friends and I are considering starting a 24/7 unmanned instant noodle cafe at NTU. We‚Äôre thinking of it as a convenient spot (near dormitories) for late-night supper or a quick meal between classes.

We‚Äôd appreciate your feedback on whether this is something you‚Äôd like to see in school.

Google form: [https://forms.gle/7B4nQyCsTcwp14oj9](https://forms.gle/7B4nQyCsTcwp14oj9)

  
Edit: Thank you guys for all the feedbacks and support! We are in the midst of discussing, and will re-evaluate the business model to see if it's feasible. Is it implemented through a honour system? Honour system wont work in NTU as there‚Äôs uncultured monkeys who steal parcels / food deliveries . Unmanned, bet somebody will take the whole cart You got the idea from South Korea? Sad to say but we don‚Äôt have the gracious culture here. You won‚Äôt be able to have enforcement, and without enforcement, Singaporeans are actually terribly uncultured. Just look at all the smoking on sidewalks, jaywalking, and not stopping for pedestrians on a daily basis. Given that Cheers already has a partially unmanned store in South Spine, there's no harm trying, but limiting to instant noodles may be too restrictive unless you are bringing/franchising the South Korean concept over. A friend of a friend tried an unmanned instant noodle stall bringing in the idea from S. Korea but had to shut it down after a few months as Singaporeans took too much of the condiments, ingredients etc. etc. and it was just not profitable as he had to keep restocking the ingredients every few hours If you have an idea just go for it, asking ppl is like inviting them to judge and throw confusion that makes you doubt yourself. We shall see if NTU students deserve good things or not. Serial entrepreneur here but a bit old hahaha
- profit is in drinks, make sure u don‚Äôt miss a drinks vending machine
- don‚Äôt trust online survey forms. It‚Äôs self selective
- u can take surveys at sites, but it‚Äôs at best, accurate to only 20-30%?
- remember you have long period of very little student activity (school periods). Not sure how it works in NTU, hope rental is paused
- marketing is super important. Once site is up, make sure everyone within 15 mins radius knows there is an instant noodle convenient store there.
- go find China convenient stores, they sell tons of packaged food that is easy to add on to the noodles.

Dm if you wanna stay in contact
Im curious to stay this biz in the past but for wellness and protein food, in a way, luckily I didn‚Äôt get started coz it‚Äôs very bad margin and low returns. If your unmanned store includes fresh meat and vegetables for those noodles, it might get some traction or else people will rather stock up on form and just pour hot water without even leaving. I would say consider dispensing from vending machine and/or RFID tagged fridge for your sides. Scan a QR code to open the fridge and payment via googlepay/applepay. More accountability for ppl. It also helps u with stock taking and forecasting. I actually think it's a good idea. I think people are over exaggerating the idea of people stealing it. For example, there is an unmanned food store in North Spine and there hasn't really been much problems with it so far, aside from the machine spoiling internally from time to time. Claw machine with unlimited tried till 1 successful drop? Can consider using a vending machine that also dispenses cutlery with each purchase, because Singaporeans are too much of scums to have an honour system. I like the idea. Dont let the doubters get to you. You miss 100 percent of the shots you don't take. Can use vending machines to dispense out the instant noodles. Only issue I see is cleaning up after people. We can install security cameras! I think a more realistic approach for OP would be to prepackage condiments and charged accordingly per package That‚Äôs so sad but super realistic. Thanks for sharing. Wow, curious where the shop was at. Can share more details? I always hope Singaporeans are more honourable and ethical than we online warriors give credit to ;( \> Hungry and wants a quick supper

\> spends 3 hours trying to catch fishball All someone needs to do is walk up with a hoodie and mask to get around that

It wont be foolproof but it will be a massive headache tracking them down, and I highly doubt school management will be cooperative beyond the first few times

There already exists vending machines that serve instant noodles as far as I know, so why not just invest in one of those if you intend to turn this into a long term business? Rather than this idealistic honor based system. Why not just hire one person to be there? Plenty of night owls in ntu willing to take up the job and $10 an hour will get you a lot better behaviour. Are you going to skim through hours of footage just to find one fella who took at most a few dollars worth of food?"
"what is the ""group"" for in online matriculation ?","hi guys ! i just matriculated online and got allocated into group GB , does anybody know what this group GB is for and what it means ? 

for context im in NBS so im not sure if the grouping is based on course or ? and my friend of the same course got allocated into group GA so would love if anybody could share an insight on this !! and is there anybody else in group GB ? ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è Give accurate answers to the freshman : ‚ùå

Troll the freshman with wrong answers only : **‚úî** GB means you will be deported to Paris where you will represent Great Britain in the 2024 Summer Olympics. GA students will represent Gabon. G = Grade
Means NTU has predetermined your grade in uni to be at most a B while your friend can attain A grade Boring answer here, GB means group B, so you will be allocated different mods from our group A friend in the first year. For example, your friend may take business law in sem 2 while you will take business law in sem 1. This is only done in nbs and it's to prevent overcrowding in classes GB = people who got into NBS with lower tier results/achievements 

GA = people who got into NBS with higher tier results/achievements

It sucks that NTU are already categorizing students. means you wills be expulsions tomorrow Good boy It means you are a good boy. im in nbs grp b oso !! That means you are taking certain modules before others, and you'll be doing Group A modules in Sem 2 instead. For context, Group B modules are mostly project-based modules (except Business Law), while the focus of Group A modules is finance. Gang bang where do u find this btw?? i just matriculated but didn‚Äôt see such info Did you give the verification from RMI as well in the attached documents or just the scrolls and transcript? this is the way Don't spread misinformation la
